<p>The COVID Support Force is currently supporting the public services to respond to the outbreak with the following activity.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3>COVID Support Force</h3>

<p>As of 5pm on 11 June, there were 3,610 military personnel committed to assist with 54 open MACA requests.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> rebalances COVID Support Force in line with national response.</p>
</div>

<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/97557/38GpPO-OFFICIAL-20200319-149-003.jpg" alt="A member of Royal Air Force personnel speaks into a walkie talkie"></div>

<h2>Strengthening public services</h2>

<h4>Personnel at readiness</h4>

<p>On 18 March the Defence Secretary announced the COVID Support Force (<abbr title="COVID Support Force">CSF</abbr>) to assist public services with their response to the coronavirus outbreak. Initially, there were 20,000 UK Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness, with up to 4,000 committed on most days.</p>

<p>Due to the public’s adherence to the lockdown measures and the increasing ability of other government Departments to maintain essential services, from 20 May the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has begun to rebalance the <abbr title="COVID Support Force">CSF</abbr>. It has been determined, in co-ordination with colleagues across government, that 7,500 personnel should now be kept at readiness to fulfil current tasks and respond to future demand. This number will be kept under review as we continue our fight against COVID-19.</p>

<p>Military reservists remain a key part of the <abbr title="COVID Support Force">CSF</abbr>. Used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction, only those with specialist skills that can meet current requests from other government departments are currently being called out.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="COVID Support Force">CSF</abbr> will continue assisting civilian authorities wherever required and no personnel will be withdrawn from tasks while the demand remains. The 12,500 being released will be returning to a range of normal duties, including preparations to deploy on future operations at home and overseas.</p>

<h4>Tackling Disinformation</h4>

<p>A small team from the Ministry of Defence, including members of 77 Brigade, is supporting the Cabinet Office’s Rapid Response Unit in its efforts to tackle disinformation. Together, they are combatting a range of harmful online narratives – from purported ‘experts’ issuing dangerous misinformation to criminal fraudsters running fishing scams.</p>

<h4>Support for Police Services</h4>

<p>A team from the 4th Regiment Royal Logistics Corps is assisting the UK Police with its <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distribution.  With all requests now being sent through a central supply chain, based at the new National Police Central Logistics Hub in Oxfordshire, police officers and staff will continue to receive the very best protection to mitigate the risks presented by public-facing roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Whilst the UK Armed Forces stand ready to assist public authorities if required, there are currently no plans for the military to participate in the enforcement of public order.</p>

<h4>Planning Support</h4>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK. Working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales, they are supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services as they respond to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98072/Ventilator_Distribution.jpg" alt="A British Army soldier moves markers across a map"></div>
<p>An Army Logistician plans distribution of ventilators.  <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p>
<p>In addition, alongside the testing that they are carrying out on the virus, our scientists, based at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>) have also been deployed directly into government departments, local resilience teams and military headquarters, to provide instant assistance, insights and advice to planners and decision makers.</p>

<p>Since mid-February, <abbr title="Defence Science Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr> have also deployed highly experienced microbiologists to increase the capacity of Public Health England and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Laboratories.</p>

<h4>Working with our NATO partners</h4>

<p>Since the outbreak began, we have been working hard to help NATO conduct an international response to the crisis. From the beginning of March, Defence Medical Services (DMS) have been at the centre of this collaboration, playing a key role in a workshop held by the Multinational Medical Co-ordination Centre. Here, they shared their experience across a range of fields, including humanitarian response.</p>

<p>DMS has also worked with NATO’s Science and Technology Organisation, and its Military Medical Centre of Excellence, providing speakers to weekly online conferences (on a variety of COVID-19 related topics) and supporting NATO’s ability to learn from the pandemic by sharing Defence’s organisational learning strategies.</p>

<p>Defence has also been active in supporting NATO’s efforts to combat the spread of harmful, false and misleading narratives, deploying two British Army experts to NATO’s new COVID-19 Communications Hub, where they are helping to lead the fight against disinformation.</p>

<h4>Supporting the National Testing Effort</h4>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98019/gov_APOSCOT-2020-029-2_Scots_COVID19_Testing-023-NT.jpg" alt="Two soldiers stand at the window of a car, ready to test its driver"></div>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have been supporting the government’s efforts to increase national testing capacity. Their efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to Regional Testing Centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment.</p>

<p>Our scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>) are also ready to play their part. If called upon, the Defence COVID Laboratory has the capacity to test at least 2000 samples a day, reporting results between 8 and 16 hours. It is part of a wider capability at Porton Down, where, in partnership with PHE, a total of up to 7000 tests per day can be taken.</p>

<h4>Mobile Testing Units</h4>

<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/99136/APOScot-2020-042-CovidPrestwick-0444.jpg" alt="A soldier looks looks into the driver window of a car, giving a thumbs up. "></div>
<p>Soldiers from 6 SCOTS have run a Coronavirus Mobile Testing Unit in Prestwick Airport and Motherwell. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown copyright.</p>

<p>The Military have also helped to create a network of Mobile Testing Units (MTUs), which are travelling the country to reach symptomatic and eligible people at sites where there is a high demand for testing. Designed in partnership with British Army engineers, the units can be set up in less than 20 minutes, with each possessing the ability to test up to 500 individuals per day.</p>

<p>Working in combination with drive-through Regional Testing Sites, there are now multiple points of access to testing, which has helped to rapidly increase the number of tests carried out each day.</p>

<p>By the end of May, over 310,633 people had been tested by Mobile Testing Units alone.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/99287/ARMYHQ_PHOTCPL4-2020_-010-119.jpg" alt="A soldier in Personal Protective Equipment holds a swab out to the viewer. "></div>

<h4>Procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Over 100 staff from Defence Equipment &amp; Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr>) have been assisting the Cabinet Office and the Department of Health and Social Care in their efforts to identify and purchase <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. To date, over 2 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> have been purchased from orders negotiated by <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> staff.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Quality Assurance Field Force have also been doing their bit, making sure that any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> sourced as part of this new supply meets the specification requirements for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and Social Care staff.</p>

<h4>Delivering personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Soldiers from 4 Close Support Squadron drop off Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) at Epsom General Hospital. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p>
<p>Military personnel are currently working to distribute <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts and organisations across the country. Between 22 February and 8 May, UK Armed Forces personnel helped to deliver over 1.18 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff on the frontlines in England. This includes 158m masks, 184 million aprons, 2.3 million gowns and 689 million gloves.</p>

<p>Tens of millions more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items have also been delivered to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts and organisations across the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/99843/Corporal_Santosh_Gurung.jpg" alt="Corporal prepares PPE for local schools. "></div>

<p>6 military specialists have also been deployed to assist <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP3 face masks. In doing this, they will help to make sure that our brilliant <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff get the protection that they deserve.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98251/APOSCOT-2020-031-PPE_TESTING_GLASGOW-026-NT.jpg" alt="A soldier and a nurse discussing a PPE mask"></div>

<h4>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> manufacturing</h4>

<p>Personnel from across all three Armed Services have also been using 3-D printers to manufacture <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> components for their <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> colleagues on the frontline.</p>

<p>At HMNB Devonport and HMNB Portsmouth, Royal Navy personnel have been manufacturing headbands for facemasks in collaboration with other dockyard agencies. They are also being joined in this effort by a small Navy team at <abbr title="Royal Naval Air Station">RNAS</abbr> Culdrose, who have set themselves the target of producing 10,000 face shields for doctors, pharmacies, care homes and charities across Cornwall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Army personnel from 22 Engineer Regiment have also been producing face shields, whilst at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Odiham, the Chinook Support Centre have been manufacturing clips to enhance the comfort of masks when they are worn for long periods.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98269/govARMYHQ_PHOTCPL4-2020_-006-070.jpg" alt="A woman in British Army uniform operates 3D printing machinery, with a row of printed objects beside her. "></div>

<h4>Delivery of testing kits to care homes</h4>

<p>In addition, the COVID Support Force is also working with the Department of Health and Social Care to provide testing support to English care homes. Working in pairs, military crews are helping to ease the burden on carers, by dropping off and collecting testing kits, using vehicles with climate controlling capabilities. By 31 May, 38,285 tests had been collected by military teams.</p>

<h4>Ambulance support</h4>

<p>Nearly 400 personnel have been mobilised to help support ambulance services across the UK. Drawn from all three services, they will provide support in a variety of roles, including driving emergency response vehicles and working in response centres. In most cases, the troops will not be providing paramedic care. However, they have all been trained in first-aid and trauma, which will mean they can support ambulance crews where required.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98421/APOSEC-2020-009-QDG-NHS-110-DH_1_.jpg" alt="A paramedic and a soldier in the back of an ambulance. "></div>
<p>An <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Paramedic shows a British Army soldier the importance of decontaminating the equipment in an ambulance. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown copyright.</p>
<p>So far, the military are providing support to the South Central Ambulance Service <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Foundation Trust, the Welsh Ambulance Services <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, the London Ambulance Service <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, the East England Ambulance Service and the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

<p>Our personnel on the ground have also been supported by scientists based at <abbr title="Defence Science Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>, who have been exploring how the virus survives in aerosols across different environments. Working with the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA), they have trialled cutting-edge technology from industry to dramatically speed up the time it takes to decontaminate an ambulance to a matter of minutes.</p>

<h4>Temporary <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospitals</h4>

<p>In recent weeks, we have been supporting the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to open new hospitals around the country, providing infrastructure, logistics and project management advice.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98180/APOWMID-2020-025-Nightingale_NEC_PW_086.jpg" alt="A British Army soldier lifting a length of copper pipe"></div>
<p>A soldier from Queens Royal Ghurkas unloads copper piping for construction of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Nightingale in Birmingham. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p>
<p>Since the first new Nightingale hospital in East London was constructed in just 9 days by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff, military personnel, civilian contractors and volunteers, facilities have been made ready across the UK. So far, the military have supported builds at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London Excel – 500 beds initially, with a potential maximum of 4,000 beds</li>
  <li>Birmingham – 500 beds initially, with a potential maximum of 2,000 beds</li>
  <li>Manchester – 500 beds initially, with a potential maximum
 of 1,000 beds</li>
  <li>Harrogate – up to 500 beds in total</li>
  <li>Bristol – up to 300 beds initially, with a potential maximum of 850 beds</li>
  <li>Exeter – up to 400 beds in total</li>
  <li>Military personnel also supported the Scottish Government and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Scotland to determine how the Scottish Exhibition Centre could be transformed into a temporary hospital.</li>
  <li>Servicemen and women were also deployed to the Principality Stadium in Cardiff to assist with the building of beds at the Dragon’s Heart Hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our scientists at <abbr title="Defence Science Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr> have also supported the effort, developing a ‘fit-testing kit’, which ensures that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> fits frontline medial workers. This not only enabled the new Nightingale hospitals to open on schedule, but has helped to support the entire <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> system over the past month.</p>

<p>Military personnel are also being deployed to assist <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff at the new hospitals, carrying out a wide range of clinical support activities, such as porterage, internal patient moves, helping medical staff to robe and disrobe with their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, equipment maintenance and stores management.</p>

<p>All personnel have received specific training for their roles, which includes the fitting and appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and familiarisation training to the medical facility to which they are assigned.</p>

<h4>Ventilators</h4>

<p>Thousands of items of life-saving medical equipment and over 2,700 ventilators, have been distributed to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospitals as part of the ongoing UK government response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98486/vents_2.jpg" alt="an NHS worker and a soldier unload a heavy piece of machinery from a lorry."></div>
<p>4 Close Support Squadron are delivering ventilators to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.  <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown copyright.</p>
<p>The majority of this support has come through the Defence Equipment &amp; Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr>) fulfilment centre, based at <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Donnington. The Centre has now dispatched over 1,000 ventilators to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospitals, and is holding over 1,400 more in stock to be deployed as required. To date, <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> have also distributed over 7,500 items of critical medical equipment, including oxygen concentrators and humidifiers to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In Hampshire, <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Odiham has also been supporting the production of ventilators, providing storage space for medical ventilator trolleys before they enter the next phase of assembly, as required by demand on production. The trolleys have been produced by a civilian consortium, supported by brands that include McLaren and other F1 Teams. The consortium is aiming to produce 15,000 new ventilators by the end of June 2020.</p>

<p>As part of the military’s response to the COVID-19 crisis, forces from <a href="https://medium.com/voices-of-the-armed-forces/joint-helicopter-command-jhc-enablers-and-multipliers-of-humanitarian-aid-and-rescue-689213379545" class="govuk-link">Joint Helicopter Command</a> are on standby to provide aviation capability in support to civil authorities.</p>

<p>A new COVID Aviation Task Force has also been established to support the government’s response to coronavirus when requested.</p>

<p>So far, military aircraft have provided assistance in a range of activites. This has included, training key workers in various locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff in the trial of the Epishuttle system, which will enable the safe and swift transportation of patients to emergency care facilities. In addition, they have also assisted with 5 medical evacuations in England and Scotland.</p>

<p>Aviation Task Force aircraft have also been helping to transport <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff around the UK. Last week, a Chinook helicopter was deployed to transport workers to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Nightingale hospitals in Bristol, Harrogate and Sunderland to carry out assurance testing and ensure that they could open on time.</p>

<p>These helicopters may be seen operating in all areas of the UK, either conducting essential preparations or supporting the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. Given the sensitive nature of some of these tasks, it would be inappropriate to give further details.</p>

<h4>Northern Ireland medical evacuations</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> A400M aircraft has supported a medical evacuation from Northern Ireland to the UK mainland. The patient was taken from Aldergrove to East Midlands Airport following a request for assistance, and is now receiving the care needed to treat their condition. Medical specialists were on board to attend to the patient throughout the transfer. This is the second time military aircraft have assisted with a medical evacuation from Northern Ireland since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Leeming COVID-19 App Trials</h4>

<p><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> eXperimental (RAFX), the digital unit at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Leeming in North Yorkshire, have been working closely with NHSX and partners to develop a smartphone app that could prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Personnel at the base are currently trialling the new app, which uses Bluetooth software to determine a user’s proximity to other devices.</p>

<p>If a person displays symptoms, they can choose to share this information with the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> via the app, which will then alert other users with whom they have been in close proximity.</p>

<h4>Oxygen tanker drivers</h4>

<p>Colour Sergeant Nick Barber is taking part in training to drive oxygen tankers in support of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p>
<p>UK Armed Forces personnel, drawn from each of the three Services, began training to drive oxygen tankers at Air Products facilities in Carrington and Port Talbot. 39 drivers and 63 driver’s mates have now completed the process and are now able to fill tankers, drive them safely and deposit their cargo at <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> facilities.</p>

<h4>Mortuaries</h4>

<p>We are working with local communities to undertake contingency planning so we can ensure the public are kept safe and that any tragic loss of life will be treated with the utmost respect and care. As a result, we have identified some potential sites that may be used to facilitate temporary mortuaries.</p>

<h2>Protecting communities</h2>

<h4>Supporting medical facilities</h4>

<p>Military personnel have been helping to install medical equipment at temporary Patient Recovery Centres in Cumbria. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p>
<p>Across the UK, service personnel have been helping local authorities to increase the capacity of their medical facilities. This has included efforts to construct beds at the Principality Stadium, Cardiff, and St Mary’s Hospital on the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Military personnel have also provided support in Cumbria, helping to set up 5 temporary Patient Recovery Centres, which will act as a halfway house for patients who have been discharged from hospital, but are not well enough to return home. Through all of these efforts, the military have supported in the provision of over 1,000 extra beds.</p>

<h4>Support to overseas territories</h4>

<p>The government is working closely with British Overseas Territories to ensure they receive the help they need to manage outbreaks of COVID-19.</p>

<p>This has included the provision of 175 personnel to Gibraltar, to support with the delivery of food and medicine to residents, and the delivery of 310kg of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to Ascension Island and St Helena.</p>

<h4>The Caribbean</h4>

<p>Inspired by our co-ordination during previous hurricane seasons, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> have formed a new military co-ordination cell with our French and Dutch allies, optimising our support for OT in the Caribbean as they co-ordinate their response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>As part of this offering, <abbr title="Royal Fleet Auxiliary">RFA</abbr> Argus is stationed in the region. She was already scheduled to provide support during the upcoming hurricane season, however she will now work alongside PHA Dixmude from France and HNLMS Karel Doorman from the Netherlands, providing help with the response to the Coronavirus pandemic if required.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence have also deployed small security assistance teams to both the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Each team will reinforce the capacity of local police and support local authorities as they plan for and mitigate against any security issues caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>On 8 May, the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> delivered Foreign Office sourced supplies to the Turks and Caicos Islands. The delivery included 6 ventilators, blood supplies and medication, all of which will help to support the islands’ healthcare system during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/99410/caribbean_image.jpg" alt="Medical supplies being carried by two individuals dressed in PPE. "></div>

<h4>The Falkland Islands</h4>

<p>Children from the Falklands, who attend school in the UK and were stranded by flight cancellations, were given priority travel home on the South Atlantic Airbridge, a frequent direct air service, owned and operated by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Alongside a military planning team, already in situ, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has deployed a small medical team, and 2 Intensive Treatment Units, to support the islands’ medical facilities.</p>

<p>In addition to supplies of oxygen, medicine and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the UK Armed Forces have also delivered essential equipment to the Falkland Islands to enable the construction of an oxygen generation plant to increase the supply of oxygen to King Edward Memorial Hospital. A Royal Air Force C-17 Globemaster delivered the equipment to British Forces South Atlantic Islands as part of the UK government’s support to the Overseas Territories during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h4>Gibraltar</h4>

<p>Around 175 military personnel have been deployed to Gibraltar to help with planning and logistics, as well as the delivery of food and medicine to residents. We are working closely with the hovernment of Gibraltar to understand their requirements and are considering an additional request for support from the Royal Gibraltar Regiment.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April, the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> delivered 70 kg of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to Ascension Island, alongside an additional 240 kg of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for onward transport to St Helena. This was part of the UK governments commitment to the Overseas Territories.</p>

<h4>Repatriation flights</h4>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have assisted with the small scale repatriation of British citizens during the Coronavirus pandemic. In early April, an <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Voyager, returning from the Falklands, repatriated a number of nationals from Senegal. They were picked up whilst the aircraft refuelled in West Africa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Nepal, British Army Gurkhas have been assisting the return of holidaymakers who were stranded in remote parts of the country. Over a period of 3 weeks, the soldiers, in collaboration with British embassy staff and local drivers, travelled over 4,000 miles through the Himalayas to 13 different districts. In all, they managed to retrieve 109 British citizens and 28 foreign nationals.</p>

<p>The military’s main contribution has, however, been assisting the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with repatriation flights from a range of countries, allowing British citizens to return home safely. So far, the UK Armed Forces have deployed an operational liaison and reconnaissance team to aid with planning, supplied medically trained personnel and provided a military runway for aircraft returning to the UK.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> has also assisted the Foreign Office in the rescue and repatriation of 12 conservationists from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. When the pandemic began, the birdwatchers were stranded on an isolated island, a full 12 days sail from the Ascension Islands. Having returned to base, they were flown back to Brize Norton by an <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> A400M Atlas, which had been resupplying the islands as part of a continuous airborne link.</p>

Initially, there were 20,000 UK Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness, with up to 4,000 committed on most days.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the public’s adherence to the lockdown measures and the increasing ability of other government Departments to maintain essential services, from 20 May the <abbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\">MOD</abbr> has begun to rebalance the <abbr title=\"COVID Support Force\">CSF</abbr>. It has been determined, in co-ordination with colleagues across government, that 7,500 personnel should now be kept at readiness to fulfil current tasks and respond to future demand. This number will be kept under review as we continue our fight against COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>Military reservists remain a key part of the <abbr title=\"COVID Support Force\">CSF</abbr>. Used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction, only those with specialist skills that can meet current requests from other government departments are currently being called out.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"COVID Support Force\">CSF</abbr> will continue assisting civilian authorities wherever required and no personnel will be withdrawn from tasks while the demand remains. The 12,500 being released will be returning to a range of normal duties, including preparations to deploy on future operations at home and overseas.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98182/AL200014001.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Navy sailors lift a box\"></div>\n<figcaption><p>Royal Navy sailors load specialist  testing equipment to deliver to the <abbr title=\"National Health Service\">NHS</abbr>. <abbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"tackling-disinformation\">Tackling Disinformation</h4>\n\n<p>A small team from the Ministry of Defence, including members of 77 Brigade, is supporting the Cabinet Office’s Rapid Response Unit in its efforts to tackle disinformation.

With all requests now being sent through a central supply chain, based at the new National Police Central Logistics Hub in Oxfordshire, police officers and staff will continue to receive the very best protection to mitigate the risks presented by public-facing roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst the UK Armed Forces stand ready to assist public authorities if required, there are currently no plans for the military to participate in the enforcement of public order.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"planning-support\">Planning Support</h4>\n\n<p>The UK Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK.

Here, they shared their experience across a range of fields, including humanitarian response.</p>\n\n<p>DMS has also worked with NATO’s Science and Technology Organisation, and its Military Medical Centre of Excellence, providing speakers to weekly online conferences (on a variety of COVID-19 related topics) and supporting NATO’s ability to learn from the pandemic by sharing Defence’s organisational learning strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Defence has also been active in supporting NATO’s efforts to combat the spread of harmful, false and misleading narratives, deploying two British Army experts to NATO’s new COVID-19 Communications Hub, where they are helping to lead the fight against disinformation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"supporting-the-nhs\">Supporting the <abbr title=\"National Health Service\">NHS</abbr>\n</h2>\n\n<h4 id=\"supporting-the-national-testing-effort\">Supporting the National Testing Effort</h4>\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/98019/gov_APOSCOT-2020-029-2_Scots_COVID19_Testing-023-NT.jpg\" alt=\"Two soldiers stand at the window of a car, ready to test its driver\"></div>\n<figcaption><p>Soldiers assisting with the testing of <abbr title=\"National Health Service\">NHS</abbr> workers for COVID-19 in a new testing facility in Glasgow Airport. <abbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The UK Armed Forces have been supporting the government’s efforts to increase national testing capacity.
