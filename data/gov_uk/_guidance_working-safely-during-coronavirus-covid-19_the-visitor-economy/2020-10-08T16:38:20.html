<h2 id="priority-actions-to-take---what-businesses-need-to-do-to-protect-staff-and-customers">Priority actions to take - what businesses need to do to protect staff and customers</h2>

<p>Seven steps to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Complete a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment.</strong> Share it with all your staff. <a href="#chapter1">Find out how to do a risk assessment</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean more often.</strong> Increase how often you clean surfaces, especially those that are being touched a lot. Ask your staff and your customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask your customers to wear face coverings</strong> in any indoor space or where required to do so by law. That is especially important if your customers are likely to be around people they do not normally meet. Some exemptions apply. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Check when to wear one, exemptions, and how to make your own</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure everyone is social distancing.</strong> Make it easy for everyone to do so by putting up signs or introducing a one way system that your customers can follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase ventilation</strong> by keeping doors and windows open where possible and running ventilation systems at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take part in NHS Test and Trace</strong> by keeping a record of all your customers for 21 days. From 18 September, this will be enforced in law. Some exemptions apply. Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a> for details. From 24 September, display an official NHS QR code poster so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details. Check Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn people with coronavirus symptoms away</strong>. If a staff member (or someone in their household) or a customer has a persistent cough, a high temperature or has lost their sense of taste or smell, they should be isolating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Further things to be aware of if your business is part of the ‘visitor economy’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Letting customers know that by law they can only visit in groups of up to 6 people</strong> (unless they are visiting as a household or support bubble which is larger than 6). Check with customers on arrival who they are with and how many people will be attending. Put up signs to remind customers to only interact with their group.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Encourage contactless payments.</strong> Whenever possible, use online booking and pre-payment and ask for contactless payments.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Understand how your business interacts with the local area.</strong> Limit risk by reducing queues on the street outside, staggering check in times and opening hours to other businesses, and advising customers to avoid particular forms of transport at busy times or routes to avoid crowded areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the 24 September:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It will be law for staff and customers to wear face coverings in retail and hospitality venues, in private hire and taxis, except when eating or drinking (or because they are exempt).</li>
  <li>Staff who can work effectively from home should now do so.</li>
  <li>Pubs and restaurants - including those in hotels and other accommodation - and venues in the entertainment, leisure and tourism sectors must be closed between 10pm and 5.00am (a full list is set out at section 1.1). Hotels and other accommodation will still be able to provide food and drink through room service between the hours of 10pm and 5am as long as it is ordered by phone or online.</li>
  <li>Businesses that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises must only provide table service. This means all food and drink (whether or not alcoholic) from these businesses must be ordered from, served at and consumed by seated customers. A business that does not sell alcohol, but sells food and drink for consumption on or near the premises, does not need to provide table service. However, food and drink must be consumed by customers while they are seated. For example, a hotel bar selling alcohol must only provide table service, and customers must be seated. A kiosk or counter that does not sell alcohol can sell food or drink over the counter, as long as they take reasonable steps to ensure customers will only consume the food or drink once seated.</li>
</ul>

<p>From 28 September, businesses and organisations will face stricter rules to make their premises COVID Secure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A wider range of leisure and entertainment venues, services provided in community centres, and close contact services will be subject to the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure requirements in law and fines of up to £10,000 for repeated breaches. These are set out at section 1.1.</li>
  <li>Employers must not knowingly require or encourage someone who is being required to self-isolate to come to work.</li>
  <li>Businesses must remind people to wear face coverings where mandated.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the priority actions to make your business safe during coronavirus, you should also read the full version of the guidance below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is to help employers, employees and the self-employed in England understand how to work safely and protect their customers during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic, keeping to the recommended <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">social distancing guidance</a> applicable at the time.</p>

<p>Public health is devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; this guidance should be considered alongside local public health and safety requirements and legislation in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For advice to businesses in other parts of the UK please see guidance set by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government, and the Welsh Government. Tourism is also a devolved competency; as such, this guidance is meant to complement any guidance in the Devolved Administrations, where relevant.</p>

<p>While this guidance applies to England, you should always consider whether there are local restrictions in place in your area. If you live, work or volunteer in an area that is experiencing a local <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> outbreak and where local restrictions have been imposed, different guidance and legislation will apply. Please consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">local restrictions pages</a> to see if any restrictions are in place in your area.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback for us, please email <a href="mailto:tourismheritagecovid@culture.gov.uk">tourismheritagecovid@culture.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed to be relevant for people who work within the visitor economy; for example people who operate or run hotels and other types of accommodation (there is also a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/hotels-and-other-guest-accommodation">hotels and other guest accommodation guidance</a>, indoor and outdoor visitor attractions guidance, and guidance for people who run or manage spaces for business or leisure events and conferences. There is also a separate guidance document on pubs and restaurants for food settings.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guidance">How to use this guidance</h2>

<p>This document sets out guidance on how to work safely within the visitor economy and for guests and visitors to these locations while minimising the risk of spreading <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. It gives practical considerations of how guidance can be applied in the workplace and at these locations which, in the case of the visitor economy, will be different for each premises or outlet. This guidance only relates to activities permitted by Her Majesty’s Government regulation.</p>

<p>Each business will need to translate this into the specific actions it needs to take, depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated. A site by site approach is essential and <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment for premises will be unique. Therefore this guidance should be used to translate to whatever areas are relevant to your business and any measures that are taken should fit safely with any operational needs.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors and other people, as well as your employees.</p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take as a business, you need to carry out an appropriate <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment, at a business and site level, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers.</p>

<p>We know many people are also keen to return to or contribute to volunteering. Organisations have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. This guidance around working safely during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> should ensure that volunteers are afforded the same level of protection to their health and safety as employees, the self-employed and customers.</p>

<p>Recognising that within the visitor economy it is common practice to operate both in your own and in third parties’ premises or venues, and to hire equipment from third parties, collaboration between groups, organisations and businesses will likely be needed to give proper effect to this guidance.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-the-visitor-economy">What do we mean by ‘the visitor economy’?</h2>

<p>The visitor economy is much broader than tourism and encompasses all staying and non-staying visitors and the activities and expenditure involved in supplying products and services for visitors by both the private and public sectors.</p>

<p>The visitor economy also encompasses a multitude of different working environments, from outdoor paid for attractions like theme parks to indoor attractions like stately homes or planetariums.</p>

<p>It also includes a variety of activities and events which take place at hotels, convention and exhibition centres and conference halls and meeting rooms.</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at business owners, operators and workers in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>hotels and other guest accommodation</strong> (including self-catering accommodation, B&amp;Bs, hostels, camping, holiday homes, caravan parks, boats and other types of accommodation including short-term letting). This guidance should be read in conjunction with the working safely in hotels and other accommodation guidance.</li>
  <li>
<strong>indoor and outdoor attractions</strong> (e.g. arcades, guided tours, theme parks, family entertainment centres, funfairs, zoos, and aquariums). The <a rel="external" href="https://www.eventsindustryforum.co.uk/index.php/11-features/14-keeping-workers-and-audiences-safe-during-covid-19">events and entertainment guidance</a> may also be useful for attractions that move around (e.g. travelling funfairs).</li>
  <li>
<strong>business events</strong> (e.g. conferences, exhibitions, conventions, consumer/trade shows and other events and meetings). Business events will be permitted in numbers larger than 30 people as soon as it is safe to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance should also be read in conjunction with other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on working safely during coronavirus</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel guidance</a> and other available sector guidance.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: That all employers carry out a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a public health emergency. Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, and in particular businesses should consider the risks to their workers and customers. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don’t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work</a> along with <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/working-safely-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm">specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces</a>.</p>

<p>Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. In a small business, you might choose to consult your workers directly. Larger businesses may consult through a health and safety representative, chosen by your employees or selected by a trade union. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take.</p>

<p><strong>How to raise a concern if you are an employee:</strong></p>

<p>First, speak to your employer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact your employee representative, if your workplace has one</li>
  <li>contact your trade union if you have one</li>
  <li>contact <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> at:</li>

<h3 id="shops-1-1">1.1 Managing risk</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority</p>
</div>

<p>Operators in the visitor economy have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s health and safety is protected.
In the context of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> this means  protecting the health and safety of your workers and customers by working through these steps in order:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to ensure their employees can work safely. From 22 September 2020, people who can work effectively from home should now do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When in the workplace, everyone should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further mitigating actions include: <br><br>– increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning, including disinfection of high footfall areas or common touchpoints with particular attention to toilets/restrooms.<br>– keeping the activity time of any activity where social distancing cannot be maintained as short as possible <br>– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other <br>– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible <br>– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others) <br>– Using screens or barriers to separate people from each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one should be forced to work in an unsafe work environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you must consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trades unions. <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukhospitality.org.uk/page/UKHospitalityGuidanceforHospitality">UKHospitality</a> has further information on many parts of the visitor economy that may help with this process, including hotels and other guest accommodation, restaurants, pubs and bars, amusement parks and holiday parks.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the risks posed by <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are currently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this thinking already. When a building or space is repurposed - for example when there is any change in use or type or use or other circumstance - there needs to be a fire risk assessment. More information can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/fire.htm">Health and Safety Executive website</a>.</p>

<p>You should consider the security implications of any changes you intend to make to your operations and practices in response to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, as any revisions may present new or altered security risks or issues with accessibility which may need mitigations. Sections 2.3 outlines the key security considerations and advice.</p>

<p>Whilst the risk to health from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is at the forefront of everyone’s minds, the threat of terrorism nonetheless remains substantial. It is essential that businesses and other organisations remain cognisant of these threats as they look to adjust their operations, ensuring that security measures are proactively adapted to support and complement other changes.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, could constitute a breach of health and safety law. The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to two years. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises.</p>

<p>From Monday 28 September it will be an offence for a relevant business to fail to take all reasonable measures to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Require adherence to the Rule of 6 (respecting all exceptions to this) when taking a booking; or allowing entry and once groups are within the premises failing to take steps to advise groups not to merge in ways that breach the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure adequate distance between tables (2m or 1m+ with appropriate mitigation).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These regulations are intended to apply to businesses in the hospitality, leisure, entertainment and tourism settings, youth centres, community centres, town halls and close contact settings. This means that premises will be fined where breaches of the guidance are identified. The regulations will be enforced by authorised persons including local authorities or the police. Enforcing officers will issue Fixed Penalty Notices immediately upon a breach occurring. These will begin at £1000, and escalate to £10000 for repeated offences.</p>

<p>From Thursday 24 September:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Relevant venues in the hospitality, entertainment, leisure and tourism sectors must be closed between 10pm and 5am. This includes businesses selling food or drink (including cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants), social clubs, casinos, bowling alleys, amusement arcades (and other indoor leisure centres or facilities), funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks and activities, and bingo halls. This will include take-aways but delivery services can continue after 10pm. Hotels will still be able to provide food and drink through room service between the hours of 10pm and 5am as long as it is ordered by phone or online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises must only provide table service. This means all food and drink (whether or not alcoholic) must be ordered from, served at and consumed by seated customers. A business that does not sell alcohol, but sells food and drink for consumption on or near the premises, does not need to provide table service. However, food and drink must be consumed by customers while they are seated. <br><br>For example, a hotel bar selling alcohol must only provide table service, and customers must be seated. A kiosk or counter that does not sell alcohol can sell food or drink over the counter, as long as they take reasonable steps to ensure customers will only consume the food or drink once seated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses offering breakfast/lunch buffets are allowed to have people order and be served by a member of staff at the food station as long as no alcohol is being served at the sitting restaurant at the time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<h3 id="shops-1-2">1.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You must share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, you should consider publishing the results on your website (and we would expect all businesses with over 50 workers to do so).</p>

<p>We would expect all businesses to demonstrate to their workers and customers that they have properly assessed their risk and taken appropriate measures to mitigate this. You should do this by displaying a notification in a prominent place in your business and on your website, if you have one.</p>

<p>Below you will find a notice you should display in your workplace to show you have followed this guidance.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ef36e3d86650c1293836d65/staying-covid-19-secure-accessible.pdf">Staying <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure in 2020</a></p>
</div>

<p>There may also be other industry standards or marks that you can use to demonstrate to any visitors, guests and customers that you have thought carefully about risk.</p>

<p>Objective: To provide top level considerations for managing customers, visitors and contractors.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Assessing the number of customers, or crowd density, that can reasonably enable social distancing within any space. This will vary depending on layout or usage. This will require taking into account the total floorspace as well as pinch points and busy areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For indoor and outdoor attractions, and business event venues, limit the number of customers or adjust the crowd density at any time. For example, by implementing timed ticketing or asking customers to book ahead where possible. From Monday 28 September it will be an offence for a relevant business to fail to take all reasonable measures to require adherence to the Rule of 6 (respecting all exemptions to this) when taking a booking, allowing entry and - once groups are within the premises failing to take steps to advise groups not to merge in ways that breach the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider how customers and employees will move in congestion areas, for example doorways between adjacent indoor spaces and outdoor spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewing how customers move through and around the venue (indoors and outdoors) and considering how you could adjust the flow of customers and employees to reduce congestion and contact; for example, queue management or one-way flow, where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing queues to ensure they do not cause a risk to individuals or other businesses, for example by introducing queuing systems, using barriers and having staff direct customers. This may include using outside premises for queuing where available and safe, for example some car parks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring any changes to entry, exit and queue management take into account reasonable adjustments for those who need them, including disabled customers. For example, maintaining pedestrian and parking access for disabled customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the particular needs of those with protected characteristics, such as those who are hearing or visually impaired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging customers to use handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser (where washing facilities are not available) as they enter the premises to reduce the risk of transmission by touching products or surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminding customers who are accompanied by children that they are responsible for supervising them at all times and should follow social distancing guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with your local authority and landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, including queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks and fire escapes outside and within the public realm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having clearly designated positions from which employees can provide assistance to customers whilst maintaining social distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with neighbouring businesses and local authorities to consider how to stagger the number of people arriving throughout the day; for example, by staggering opening hours which could help reduce the demand on public transport at key times and avoid overcrowding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any activities which involve passing objects around (e.g. in casinos or indoor attractions, specifically including environments such as laser tag) the following steps should be considered: <br><br>– Putting in place picking up and dropping off collection points where possible, rather than passing goods hand to hand <br> -Regular cleaning of these objects or replacement with new objects as and when needed <br>- Encouraging increased handwashing and introducing more handwashing facilities for workers and customers or providing hand sanitiser where this is not practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where changing facilities and toilets are required, setting clear use and more frequent cleaning guidance for toilets, showers, lockers and changing rooms to ensure they are kept clean and clear of personal items, where possible safe ventilation is increased and that social distancing is achieved as much as possible, including for example by staggered shift usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a premises delivers a mix of services, ensuring only those services that are permitted to be open are available.  For example, a hairdresser should ensure that beauty or nail treatments are not offered; and a community or leisure centre should not host indoor sports or fitness activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing written or spoken communication of the latest guidelines to both workers and customers inside and outside the venue. You should may want to display posters or information setting out how customers should behave at your venue to keep everyone safe.</p>

<li>
<p>Any requirement or recommendation for visitors or guests to wear face coverings when queuing or while inside the attraction/event or hotel should be consistent with the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">government guidance</a>. Face coverings can be made at home and visitors should be signposted to the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">government guidance</a>. <br><br> <strong>From Thursday 24 September:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be law for staff and customers to wear face coverings in retail and hospitality venues, in private hire and taxis, except when eating or drinking (or because they are exempt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pubs and restaurants, and venues in the entertainment, leisure and tourism sectors must be closed between 10pm and 5am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a business serves alcohol for consumption on the premises, food and drink must be ordered from, and served at, a table. In any other premises where food or drinks are served they must be consumed at a table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>People should continue to socially distance from those they do not live with wherever possible. You must not meet with people from other households socially in groups of more than six, unless an exemption applies. The latest information on social contact can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting others safely (social distancing) guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It is against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces).</p>

<p>Businesses and venues following <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidelines can host larger groups,  if this is in accordance with the relevant guidance for their sector. Events for larger groups may also take place in public outdoor spaces that are organised by businesses, charitable or political organisations, and public bodies, provided they take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of transmission, in line with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidance and including completion of a risk assessment.</p>

<p>In particular, those operating venues or running events following <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidelines should take additional steps to ensure the safety of the public and prevent large gatherings or mass events from taking place.</p>

<p>From 15 August, venues can permit indoor performances to socially distanced audiences, including drama, comedy and music. Performances must be in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts">Performing Arts guidance</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Tours</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coach Tours:</strong> If it is possible to ensure that groups of more than six (or larger if they are from one household) do not mingle on a tour, it can go ahead. People must stay in their own group on all parts of the tour - for example whilst in hospitality settings and when visiting attractions as well as whilst on the coach. Legislation does not place any capacity constraints on public transport services, private hire vehicles or leisure tours. Operators should continue to provide Covid-secure transport services which can accommodate multiple groups of six people. DfT will update the transport guidance shortly to clarify and assist passengers and operators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Guided tours:</strong> If it is possible to ensure that groups of more than six (or larger if they are from one household) do not mingle on a guided tour, it can go ahead. People must stay in their own group at all times throughout the tour. Tours may take place indoors or outdoors provided businesses undertake risk assessments in line with this guidance document and put any necessary mitigations in place.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Individual businesses or venues should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue</li>
  <li>staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.</li>
  <li>arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues</li>
  <li>advising patrons to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities should avoid issuing licenses for events that do not comply with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure Guidelines and which could risk compromising social distancing and lead to mingling between groups of six and should provide advice to businesses on how to manage events of this type. If appropriate, the government has powers under schedule 22 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 to close venues hosting large gatherings or prohibit certain events (or types of event) from taking place.</p>

<p>All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes - but is not limited to - refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, including if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission - particularly from aerosol and droplet transmission. We will develop further guidance, based on scientific evidence, to enable these activities as soon as possible. You should take similar steps to prevent other close contact activities - such as communal dancing - and reconfigure entertainment spaces to enable customers to be seated at a fixed safe distance rather than standing. For example, repurposing dance floors for customer seating.</p>

<p>From Monday 28 September it will be an offence for a relevant business to fail to take all reasonable measures to require adherence to the Rule of 6 (respecting all exemptions to this) when taking a booking, allowing entry and - once groups are within the premises failing to take steps to advise groups not to merge in ways that breach the rule.</p>

<p>Reconfiguring entertainment spaces to enable customers to be seated at a fixed safe distance rather than standing. For example, repurposing dance floors for customer seating.</p>

<p><strong>Test and Trace</strong></p>

<p>Continued opening up of the economy and public services is reliant on NHS Test and Trace being used to minimise transmission of the virus.  In order to ensure that businesses and local services are able to remain open, we will be mandating that organisations in designated sectors must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people) to provide their name and contact details.</li>
  <li>Keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details.</li>
  <li>Keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested.
display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details.</li>
  <li>Adhere to General Data Protection Regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the hospitality sector will be required to ensure that anyone visiting pubs, restaurants and other venues provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS QR code before being allowed entry to the venue.</p>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.</p>

<p>You can find out more about these requirements in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors guidance</a></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will be needed will include:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Preventing the attendance of anyone who is symptomatic; has recently been  symptomatic; tested positive for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>; or if they are a contact of someone symptomatic or has been identified by the NHS Test &amp; Trace programme as someone who has been a close contact of a case.

</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the potential for transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> during meetings, for example avoiding sharing pens and other objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging customers to use handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser (where washing facilities are not available) as they enter the premises to reduce the risk of transmission by touching products or surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that meeting rooms are cleaned thoroughly between users and the frequent touch points such as door handles and surfaces are continuously kept clean through an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that social distancing applies to all parts of a premises where the meeting is being conducted, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, canteens and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain social distancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding meetings outdoors or in well-ventilated rooms whenever possible. See below for more information on air ventilation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having socially distanced seating and/or spacing out any tables to meet social distancing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When indoors avoid those speaking doing so directly face to face with other participants whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking steps to avoid loud speaking or shouting, such as not using background music, and the use of microphones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For areas where regular meetings take place, using floor signage to help people maintain social distancing.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="heritage-attractions-and-buildings">2.2.3 Heritage attractions and buildings</h4>

<p>DCMS and Historic England have drafted <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/heritage-locations">guidance on recommendations specifically for heritage or listed buildings</a>. If part or all of your business includes heritage assets or listed buildings, please also refer to this for guidance to enable you to open and operate.</p>

<h3 id="overarching-security-considerations">2.3 Overarching security considerations</h3>

<p>Adapting to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> measures will inevitably result in changes to operating policies, processes and procedures of accommodation providers, indoor and outdoor attractions and business event centres and venues. Any changes should always be considered alongside security implications.  If you have a security department or manager, they should be consulted to help ensure good security is maintained as far as possible and that there are no unintended security consequences as a result of changes. This should be achieved by conducting a security risk assessment.</p>

<p>Specific examples of where security implications may arise are: queueing, search and screening (where this has been directed by a wider government policy on security), maintaining vigilance for potential threats, and access controls. There may be others that your organisation will need to consider.</p>

<h4 id="queues-and-social-distancing">2.3.1 Queues and social distancing</h4>

<p>Whilst dense crowding is unlikely if social distancing is operating correctly, the revised layout of spaces may present new security risks, particularly where multiple queues are created.</p>

<p>Considerations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operators should try and organise queuing within existing protected areas; Operators should NOT remove any security features or useful street furniture items without considering protective security in the round.</li>
  <li>If queuing is only possible outside of protected areas then consider and mitigate the vulnerabilities by: routing queues behind permanent physical structures (e.g. street furniture, bollards, trolley parks and bike racks) to provide a visual deterrent and delay; closing off vehicle access to shared spaces; adjusting servicing and delivery times; reducing the opportunities for vehicles (including potentially hostile vehicles) to interact with pedestrians; erecting robust barriers; introducing a reduced speed limit or traffic calming measures.</li>
  <li>Operators should be careful to avoid giving credible, detailed information that could help a hostile entity identify an attractive target and carry out an attack. In particular, this should not be included in detailed risk assessments published on public websites under Section 1.2. Be mindful of messaging, both at the site and particularly on-line, which covers detailed information about queue locations and times, the number of people expected, and suggesting removal of security features such as street furniture, bollards etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="search-and-screening">2.3.2 Search and screening</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct of physical search and screening of staff, contractors and visitors may need adapting in order to adhere to social distancing measures.</li>
  <li>To maintain effective security and deterrence, search and screening should still be conducted as appropriate and in line with the organisation’s policies.</li>
  <li>Ensure security staff are and feel safe. For example, having access to hand-washing facilities, and that they are able and confident to raise any concerns.</li>
  <li>The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) has published guidance on adapting existing search and screening processes to take account of physical distancing.  Details are also available from your local Police Counter Terrorism Security Advisor (CTSA), which are available online.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="staff-security-officers-and-stewarding">2.3.3. Staff, security officers and stewarding</h4>

<p>It is vital for staff to remain vigilant and act on potential security threats including terrorism and wider criminality. It is advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continue to ensure that awareness of security threats is raised alongside safety and health risks through staff briefings.</li>
  <li>Whilst stewards and security officers may be focused on managing people and queues for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety reasons, they should continue to remain vigilant for and report any suspicious activity as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Ideally consider providing separate stewarding to manage the social distancing and other safety aspects to enable your security staff to focus on their core responsibilities to keep the site safe from threats.</li>
  <li>Ensure there is a good communication system in place to inform people of any incident. Carry out a short exercise or test to check procedures and equipment for this are working correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="restricted-entry-points">2.3.4 Restricted entry points</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Restricted access entry points, such as those facilitated by keypad, biometrics and/or pass should remain fully in operation. They should not be deactivated.</li>
  <li>Pin pads and biometrics should be highlighted as “touch points” and cleaned regularly (note: generally, they are touched less than door handles)</li>
  <li>Access control (staff) proximity cards will work up to 10cm from the reader. Staff can be informed that there is no need to physically touch the card on the reader.</li>

<p>Objective: Employers should ensure workplaces are safe whilst also enabling working from home.</p>
</div>

<p>To help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so over the winter. Where an employer, in consultation with their employee, judges an
employee can carry out their normal duties from home, they should do so. Public sector
employees working in essential services should continue to go into work where necessary. Anyone else who cannot work from home should go to their place of work. The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.</p>

<p>Businesses should consider the impact of workplace reopening on local transport, and take appropriate mitigating actions (e.g. staggered start and finish times for staff). When it is decided that workers should come into their place of work then this will need to be reflected in the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment and actions taken to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance. It is vital employers engage with workers to ensure they feel safe returning to work, and they should not force anyone into an unsafe workplace.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To protect clinically vulnerable and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#shops-appendix">Clinically extremely vulnerable individuals</a> may be advised not to work outside the home if the prevalence of disease in the community is very high. Current advice can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If clinically vulnerable individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered the option of the safest available on-site roles, enabling them to stay at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">recommended distance</a> away from others. If they have to spend time within this distance of others, you should carefully assess whether the activity should continue. If so, further mitigating actions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission between individuals (see Section 3 for examples of actions that can be taken). As for any workplace risk you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found.</p>

</div>

<p>You should maintain social distancing in the workplace wherever possible.</p>

<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>

<p>Mitigating actions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning, including disinfecting of heavy footfall and frequent touch points, with particular attention to shared showers, changing rooms, and toilets/restrooms</li>
  <li>provision of hand sanitiser in areas where poor access to hand washing</li>
  <li>keeping the activity time involved as short as possible</li>
  <li>using screens or barriers to separate people from each other</li>
  <li>using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible</li>
  <li>reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)</li>
  <li>Using screens or barriers to separate people from each other. These are particularly appropriate where an individual cannot maintain social distancing and is in contact with a high volume of people such as ticket office staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Social distancing applies to all parts of a premises business is conducted, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, canteens and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain social distancing.</p>

<h2 id="personal-protective-equipment-ppe-and-face-coverings">6. Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) and face coverings</h2>

<p><abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks.</p>

<p>Where you are already using <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in your work activity to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, you should continue to do so.</p>

<p>From Thursday 24 September it will be law for staff and customers to wear face coverings in retail and hospitality venues, in private hire and taxis, except when eating or drinking (or because they are exempt).</p>

<p>All businesses are required to remind customers to wear a mask where already mandated.</p>

<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you should take to manage <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/5-steps-to-working-safely">recommended distance away</a> from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When managing the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, additional <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, for example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>: personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) plan</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to protect against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required, then you should provide this <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided should fit properly. Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering">face covering</a> by law in some public places unless you have a <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering">reasonable excuse for not wearing one or you are not able to wear one</a>, for example, because of your age or a health condition.</p>
