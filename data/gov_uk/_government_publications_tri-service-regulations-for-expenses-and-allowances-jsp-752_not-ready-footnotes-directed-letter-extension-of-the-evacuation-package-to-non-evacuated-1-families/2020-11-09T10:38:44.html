<p><strong>Extension of the evacuation package to “non-evacuated” <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> families</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dated: 3 November 2020</strong></p>

<p>I am directed to inform you of the following clarification for Service personnel (<abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>), and/or their immediate family, assigned overseas who were not formally evacuated but who returned to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for reasons caused by Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, but then found themselves stranded and unable to return to their overseas duty station due to travel restrictions or mandatory periods of quarantine or isolation. These families found themselves ineligible for a number of allowances and expenses laid down in <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/923557/20201001-JSP_752_v44_Oct_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">JSP 752 Chap 12 Sect 6</a> as they had not been formally evacuated.</p>

<p>The aim of the Evacuation Package is, under normal circumstances, to assist <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and their accompanying immediate family who are ordered to evacuate their permanent overseas duty station to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or to an alternative region. Both the evacuation and the location to which they are moved must be authorised by the Head of Mission after consultation with their relevant section of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>), or a nominated military commander. The package does not ordinarily extend to non-evacuated families.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>, and/or their immediate family, have departed the overseas duty station back to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and subsequently become stranded and unable to return, exceptional authority is granted for entitlement to certain provisions in <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/923557/20201001-JSP_752_v44_Oct_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">JSP 752 Chap 12 Sect 6</a> from the date they departed the overseas duty station until the date the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and/or the family were/are able to return to the overseas duty station after restrictions were/are lifted. Entitlement to the exceptional authority given in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> is subject to the caveats listed at paragraph 21.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> provides the entitlements detailed in the following paragraphs.</p>

<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

<p>The options for accommodation are outlined in the following paragraphs and it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. It is recognised, however, that familial circumstances will vary and not every option will be practicable for every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some families (for example, rule of 6 etc). <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action.</p>

<h3 id="service-families-accommodation-sfa-or-services-cotswold-centre-scc">Service Families Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) or Services Cotswold Centre (<abbr title="Services Cotswold Centre">SCC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Service families may be given the choice of where to be accommodated in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, where surplus <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is available, or at the <abbr title="Services Cotswold Centre">SCC</abbr> at Corsham (collectively referred to as service accommodation). Families wishing to occupy service accommodation may apply for it via their chain of command responsible for welfare support as detailed in <a rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/defnet/Corp/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B23233489-9B80-4244-B8EA-C77D6E5C5BC9%7D&amp;file=2019DIN01-141.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1&amp;cid=7bb91209-b312-44a0-9b30-e61d84609201" class="govuk-link">DIN2019 DIN01-141</a> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The provision of service accommodation should be handled on a case by case basis taking into account the specific needs of each family. The following conditions will apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a.	There will be no liability for accommodation charges (including <abbr title="Contributions in Lieu of Council Tax">CILOCT</abbr> (Contributions in Lieu of Council Tax)) arising from occupation of service accommodation under this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>. This is on the understanding that, where the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has remained at the permanent overseas assignment station, they continue to pay the appropriate Service accommodation charges in respect of <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (or equivalent) that they are occupying. Service accommodation charges for the family will continue to be waived after the 90-day point as previously directed by <abbr title="Chief of Defence People">CDP</abbr>. The <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will be liable for payment of all utility and associated bills during the period of their family’s occupation of Service Accommodation with effect from the date of their family’s occupation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b.	Where <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is allocated, it may not necessarily be at the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s first location preference or normal entitlement. <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> should accept <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> offered, regardless of location or entitlement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c.	As service accommodation will have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="serviced-apartments--hotel-accommodation">Serviced Apartments &amp; Hotel Accommodation</h3>

<p>If service accommodation is/was not available or practicable then, subject to the family circumstances, the family may stay in a serviced apartment for the duration of the period that they are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. The serviced apartment must be booked by E-Mailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>) <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Costs will be met by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim. Since the serviced apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable.</p>

<p>If there are no serviced apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs may be claimed up to £25-pounds for each day, for each member of the family <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. This is from the date on which they were stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for up to 90 days or until service accommodation is/became available; whichever is earlier. There is no entitlement to claim Subsistence after 90 days without evidence that service accommodation is/was not available (for example, Non-Availability Certificate. Allocated service accommodation may not necessarily be provided at the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s first location preference and this does not automatically give entitlement to Subsistence beyond the 90-day point.</p>

<h3 id="privately-arranged-rented-accommodation">Privately Arranged Rented Accommodation</h3>

<p>The reimbursement of costs for privately arranged rented accommodation will only be considered if there is no appropriate service accommodation, serviced apartments or hotel accommodation available <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. If the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and/or immediate family choose (or chose) not to occupy Service accommodation or have been (or were) offered service accommodation and declined, the cost of any privately arranged rented accommodation will not be met from public funds.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and/or their immediate family were not offered service accommodation, as they did not originally qualify, they may now be refunded privately arranged rented accommodation costs, subject to Budget Holder approval, on production of receipted costs using this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> as authority <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. Reimbursement of privately arranged rented accommodation will be limited to within the rental ceilings for the location concerned which are considered reasonable by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will remain liable for payment of all utility and associated bills during the period of their family’s occupation of privately arranged rented accommodation with effect from the date of occupation.</p>

<p>Privately arranged rented accommodation must have self-catering facilities, therefore no subsistence allowance is payable.</p>

<h3 id="privately-arranged-rate-par">Privately Arranged Rate (<abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> allows <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> to make private arrangements for them and/or their family to stay with relatives or friends, when service accommodation is not available. The daily rate of <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> is designed to cover a 24-hour period and contribute towards all expenses incurred during that period (for example, all meals, accommodation costs (if any) and a gift for the hosts etc). Only one <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night, irrespective of the number of family members. Where <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> are in receipt of <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr>, Day and Night Subsistence cannot be claimed. <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> may remain in issue beyond the 90-day point, but only until service accommodation becomes available. Therefore, there is no entitlement to claim <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> after 90 days without evidence that service accommodation is/was not available (for example, Non-Availability Certificate). Allocated service accommodation may not necessarily be provided at the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s first location preference; this does not automatically give entitlement to <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> beyond the 90-day point.</p>

<h3 id="local-overseas-allowance-loa">Local Overseas Allowance (<abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Accompanied rates of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> remain in issue if the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> remained at the overseas duty station and on the understanding that the family will return to the overseas location. If it is later decided that the family will not return, then the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will revert to the unaccompanied rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>. Where the family are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> remaining at the permanent duty station, the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will be considered <abbr title="Involuntary Separation">INVOLSEP</abbr> (but not for the purposes of <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>) until such time as their family returns to the overseas location or, they reach the end of their assignment. In this instance, <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will only become eligible for <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>, if and from the point at which the assignment is designated ‘Unaccompanied’ for the remainder of the assignment.</p>

<p>Where both the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and family are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, residual rates of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> remain in issue if it is expected that the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and family will return to the overseas location. If it is later decided that the family will not return, the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> would revert to residual rate of unaccompanied <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> until they return to the overseas location, at which point they would receive the appropriate full unaccompanied rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="cost-of-living-addition-cola">Cost of Living Addition (<abbr title="Cost of Living Addition">COLA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Cost of Living Addition">COLA</abbr> will remain in issue at the accompanied Rate for first 60 days if the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> remained at the overseas duty station. From Day 61 the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will revert to the unaccompanied rate for remainder of their family’s absence. Where the family are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> but the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> remains at permanent duty station, the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will be considered <abbr title="Involuntary Separation">INVOLSEP</abbr> from the point that they are placed on unaccompanied rates of <abbr title="Cost of Living Addition">COLA</abbr> and receive the appropriate level of <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> until such time as their family is able to return to the overseas location or they reach the end of their assignment. If the family, once notified that they can return, decide not to return to the overseas location, then the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will be deemed to be <abbr title="Voluntary Separation">VOLSEP</abbr> and the <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> entitlement will change accordingly.</p>

<p>Where both the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and family are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, the accompanied rate of <abbr title="Cost of Living Addition">COLA</abbr> remains in issue for 60 days. From day 61 entitlement to <abbr title="Cost of Living Addition">COLA</abbr> and Hardship ceases for remainder of the period that they are stranded in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="telephone-charges-and-wifi">Telephone Charges and WiFi</h3>

<p>The purchase of 4G top-up cards and <abbr title="Pay as you Go">PAYG</abbr> WiFi up to £55 per week until they return to the overseas location or it is decided that they will not be returning to the overseas location.</p>

<h3 id="mandatory-quarantine-and-covid-19-testing">Mandatory Quarantine and <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Testing</h3>

<p>If, on re-entry to the overseas location, the host government requires mandatory periods of quarantine in accommodation that is not service accommodation or the SPs privately owned/rented accommodation, <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> affected by the circumstances outlined in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> may reclaim the cost for themselves and any immediate family travelling with them, subject to Budget Holder Approval. This should be claimed under duty travel subsistence costs on <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If, on re-entry to the overseas location, the host government requires a <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test be carried out prior to re-entry, <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> affected by the circumstances outlined in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> may reclaim the cost for themselves and any immediate family travelling with them through <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> in accordance with <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/923557/20201001-JSP_752_v44_Oct_2020.pdf" class="govuk-link">JSP 752 Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 17</a>. Claims should be made to your UIN under a Miscellaneous Expense Claim and then select “Medical, Dental, Opticians Prescription Fees” as the Expense Type. “<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>” should be recorded in the justification box.</p>

<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3>

<p>Entitlement to the provisions of this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> are subject to the following caveats:</p>

<p>a.	The <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> must provide evidence to their Unit HR that the child was unable to remain at the school or university (halls of residence or privately arranged rented accommodation);</p>

<p>b.	The <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> must provide evidence to their Unit HR that it was not practicable for the appointed guardian, friends or relatives to care for their child</p>

<p>c.	The <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> must provide evidence to their Unit HR that they and/or their immediate family were unable to travel back to the overseas location due to travel restrictions, mandatory periods of quarantine or the non-availability of flights</p>

<p>d.	If the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has/had been offered service accommodation for themselves and/or their immediate family, regardless of location and declined, there will be no entitlement to the reimbursement of costs associated with privately arranged rented accommodation. Where, however, there are clear mitigating circumstances, for example, additional needs, proximity to necessary medical care etc, costs may be reimbursed following the submission of casework to the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr>.</p>

<p>e.	Where <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has removed a tenant from their own property in order that they may live there, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is not responsible for any loss of income.</p>

<p>f.	If the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and/or their immediate family are in privately arranged rented accommodation and find themselves now eligible for service accommodation due to the exceptional authority given in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>, there is no entitlement to claim private accommodation costs after 90 days from the date of this letter without evidence that service accommodation is/was not available (for example, Non-Availability Certificate). Allocated service accommodation may not necessarily be provided at the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s first location preference. This does not give entitlement beyond the 90-day point.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>It is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending school in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at all times. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area for those assigned overseas. <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> should make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Government</a>, Defence (<a rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/HOCS/Pages/Defence-policy-statements.aspx" class="govuk-link">Defence Advice Notes</a>) as well as any guidance and arrangements published by host nations. Parents should also ensure that they inform their <abbr title="Chain of Command">CofC</abbr> of any changes to their personal circumstances.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Self-isolation requirements are set out in the Government guidance available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The terms of this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances)</strong>. Any additional costs associated with the arrangements covered in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> should be recorded so that they are available should this information be required later. The inadvertent omission of any restrictions of entitlements in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> does not, by implication, create any other unmentioned allowance or expense entitlements.</p>
