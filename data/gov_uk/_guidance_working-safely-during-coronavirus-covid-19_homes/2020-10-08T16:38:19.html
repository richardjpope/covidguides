<p>Seven steps to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Complete a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment</strong>. Share it with all your staff. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you donâ€™t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm">Find out how to do a risk assessment</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean more often</strong>. Increase how often you clean surfaces, especially those that are being touched a lot. Ask your staff and your customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask your customers to wear face coverings</strong> where required to do so by law. That is especially important if your customers are likely to be around people they do not normally meet. Some exemptions apply. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Check when to wear one, exemptions, and how to make your own</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure everyone is social distancing</strong>. Make it easy for everyone to do so by putting up signs or introducing a one-way system that your staff and customers can follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase ventilation</strong> by keeping doors and windows open where possible and running ventilation systems at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take part in NHS Test and Trace</strong> by keeping a record of all your staff and contractors for 21 days. From 18 September, this will be enforced in law. Some exemptions apply. Check â€˜<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a>â€™ for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn people with coronavirus symptoms away</strong>. If a staff member (or someone in their household) or a customer has a persistent cough, a high temperature or has lost their sense of taste or smell, they should be isolating. By law from 28 September employers must not require someone who is being required to self-isolate to come to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Five more things to be aware of if your business provides services in other peopleâ€™s homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Explain safety measures</strong> to your customer before entering their home. Make sure that members of the household know they should maintain social distancing from you.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Avoid crowded areas</strong>. Identify busy locations in the house such as hallways and avoid moving through them where possible.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Limit contact with customers</strong>. Bring your own food and drink and take breaks outside where possible. Avoid sharing items such as pens or tools.</li>
  <li>
<strong>When working in a household with people at higher risk</strong>, take extra measures to avoid contact, such as working in a separate room from them.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Communicate and train</strong>. Make sure allâ€¯staff and customersâ€¯are kept up to date with how safety measures are being used.â€¯</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the priority actions to make your business safe during coronavirus. You should also read the full version of the guidance below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic. It is critical that employers, employees, the self-employed and customers take steps to keep everyone safe. This document is to help employers, employees and the self-employed in the UK understand how to work safely during this pandemic, ensuring as many people as possible comply with social distancing guidelines (2m apart, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable). We hope it gives you freedom within a practical framework to think about what you need to do to continue, or restart, operations during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic. We understand how important it is that you can work safely and support your employeesâ€™ and customersâ€™ health and wellbeing during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic and not contribute to the spread of the virus. The government is clear that workers should not be forced into an unsafe workplace and the health and safety of workers and customers, and public health, should not be put at risk.</p>

<p>We know many people are also keen to return to or contribute to volunteering. Organisations have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. This guidance around working safely during COVID-
19 should ensure that volunteers are afford the same level of protection to their health and safety as others, such as workers and customers.</p>

<p>This document has been prepared by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) with input from firms, unions, industry bodies and the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and in consultation with Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Public health is devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; this guidance should be considered alongside local public health and safety requirements and legislation in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For advice to businesses in other parts of the UK please see guidance set by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government.</p>

<p>We expect that this document will be updated over time. This version is up to date as of 24 September 2020. You can check for updates at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workingsafely">www.gov.uk/workingsafely</a>. If you have any feedback for us, please email <a href="mailto:safer.workplaces@beis.gov.uk">safer.workplaces@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>This document is one of a set of documents about how to work safely in different types of workplace. This one is designed to be relevant for people who provide services in, and to, peopleâ€™s homes (whether employed or self-employed) as well as employers of these individuals (which may include households). It will also be relevant to agencies who work with these individuals.</p>

<p>People delivering close contact services in other peopleâ€™s homes should also refer to guidance on keeping workers and clients safe during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in close contact services.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guidance">How to use this guidance</h2>

<p>This document sets out guidance on how to open workplaces safely while minimising the risk of
spreading <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. It gives practical considerations of how this can be applied in the workplace.</p>

<p>Each business will need to translate this into the specific actions it needs to take, depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated. They will also need to monitor these measures to make sure they continue to protect customers and workers.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. It contains non-statutory guidance to take account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors and other people, as well as your employees.</p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take, you must carry out an appropriate <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-working-in-other-peoples-homes">What do we mean by â€˜working in other peopleâ€™s homesâ€™?</h2>

<p>We acknowledge that this is a complex environment due to the varied employment relationships, including the self-employed, employers and agencies.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to those working in, visiting or delivering to home environments. These include, but are not limited to, people working in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in home workers â€“ such as repair services, fitters, meter readers, plumbers, cleaners, cooks, visiting childcare providers, and surveyors (this is not an exhaustive list)</li>
  <li>to home services â€“ such as delivery drivers momentarily at the door</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance does not directly apply to live-in nannies who spend all their time with one household, or to their employers.</p>

</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: That all employers carry out a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a public health emergency. Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, and in particular businesses should consider the risks to their workers and customers. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. You should also consider the security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place, as any revisions could present new or altered security risks that may require mitigation. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you donâ€™t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work</a> along with <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/working-safely-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm">specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces</a>.</p>

<p>Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. You are encouraged to have individual discussions with your workers where reasonable, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and therefore may be returning to the workplace, to consider any uncertainties they have about precautions in place to make the workplace COVID-secure. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isnâ€™t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. These actions include closure of venues under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 3) Regulations 2020. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, could constitute a breach of health and safety law. The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to two years. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UKâ€™s fight against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> by working with the government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p>Employers must follow all instructions from authorities in the event of new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">local restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="homes-1-1">1.1 Managing risk</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority</p>
</div>

<p>Employers have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybodyâ€™s health and safety is protected. In the context of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> this means protecting the health and safety of your workers and clients by working through these steps in order:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Ensuring both workers and visitors who feel unwell stay at home and do not attend the premises. By law from 28 September businesses may not require a self-isolating employee to come into work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to ensure their employees can work safely. Any office worker who can work from home should do so. Anyone else who cannot work from home should go to their place of work, if <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidelines are followed closely. When in the workplace, everyone should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable). From 1 August, clinically extremely vulnerable individuals, who were previously advised to shield at home, can go to the workplace as long as it is COVID-secure, but should carry on working from home wherever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity can be redesigned to maintain a 2m distance or 1m with risk mitigations where 2m is not viable. <br><br>Further mitigating actions include: <br><br>â€“ further increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning<br>â€“ keeping the activity time involved as short as possible <br>â€“ using screens or barriers to separate people from each other. <br>â€“ using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible <br>â€“ reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using â€˜fixed teams or partneringâ€™ (so each person works with only a few others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, even through redesigning a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, including if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission. We will develop further guidance, based on scientific evidence, to enable these activities as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment. <br><br>In your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you must consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trades associations.</p>

<p>If you are currently operating, you will already have carried out an assessment of the risks posed by <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in your workplace. Use this document to identify any further improvements you should make. You must review the measures you have put in place to make sure they are working. You should also review them if they may no longer be effective or if there are changes in the workplace that could lead to new risks.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed when working in homes:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>No work should be carried out in a household which is isolating because one or more family members has symptoms or where an individual has been advised to shield - unless it is to remedy a direct risk to the safety of the household.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When working in a household where somebody is clinically vulnerable, but has not been asked to shield, for example, the home of someone over 70, prior arrangements should be made with vulnerable people to avoid any face-to-face contact, for example, when answering the door. You should be particularly strict about handwashing, coughing and sneezing hygiene, such as covering your nose and mouth and disposing of single-use tissues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying updated with the latest guidance and considering how it can be applied to your work. This can include: <br><br>â€“ washing your hands more often than usual for 20 seconds using soap and hot water, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose <br><br>â€“ reducing the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze by covering your mouth and nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you donâ€™t have a tissue and throw the tissue in a bin immediately, then wash your hands <br><br>â€“ cleaning regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people <br><br>â€“ communicating with households prior to any visit to discuss how the work will be carried out to minimise risk for all parties <br><br>â€“ maintaining social distancing guidelines (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable) as far as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="homes-1-2">1.2 Sharing your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You must share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, you should consider publishing the results on your website (and we would expect all businesses with over 50 workers to do so). We would expect all businesses to demonstrate to their workers and customers that they have properly assessed their risk and taken appropriate measures to mitigate this. You should do this by displaying a notification in a prominent place in your business and on your website, if you have one.</p>

<p>Below you will find a notice you should sign and display in your workplace to show you have followed this guidance. <br><br></p>

<div class="example">
<p>Objective: Employers should ensure workplaces are safe for anyone who cannot work from home.</p>

<p>It is recognised that for providers of in-home services, it is often not possible to work from home.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to keep the virus under control, it is important that people work safely. At the present time, office workers who can work from home should do so. Anyone else who cannot work from home should go to their place of work. The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidelines are followed closely. Employers should consult with their employees to determine who can come into the workplace safely taking account of a personâ€™s journey, caring responsibilities, protected characteristics, and other individual circumstances. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk. Businesses should consider the impact of workplaces reopening on local transport and take appropriate mitigating actions (e.g. staggered start and finish times for staff). When employers consider that workers should come into their place of work, then this will need to be reflected in the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> workplace risk assessment and actions taken to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance. It is vital employers engage with workers to ensure they feel safe returning to work, and they should not force anyone into an unsafe workplace.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Planning for a phased return to work for poeple safely and effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding digital or remote alternatives to physical, in-home work where possible such as video or phone consultations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussing working environment and practices with householders and clients in advance to confirm how the work will be carried out, if a physical visit is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employers and agencies should keep in touch with workers, who they might usually meet with face-to-face, on their working arrangements including their welfare, mental and physical health and personal security.</p>

<h3 id="homes-2-1">2.1 Protecting people who are at higher risk</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To support those who are at higher risk of infection and/or an adverse outcome if infected.</p>
</div>

<p>The Public Health England report <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">Disparities in the risk and outcomes of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a> shows that some groups of people may be at more risk of being infected and/or an adverse outcome if infected.</p>

<p>The higher-risk groups include those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are older males</li>
  <li>have a high body mass index (BMI)</li>
  <li>have health conditions such as diabetes</li>
  <li>are from some Black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider this in your risk assessment.</p>

<p>From 1 August, <a href="#vehicles-appendix">clinically extremely vulnerable individuals</a> can return to their workplace providing COVID-secure guidelines are in place but should work from home wherever possible. If extremely clinically vulnerable individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered the option of the safest available on-site roles, enabling them to maintain social distancing guidelines (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable). It may be appropriate for clinically extremely vulnerable individuals to take up an alternative role or adjusted working patterns temporarily.</p>

<p>As for any workplace risk you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found. Particular attention should also be paid to people who live with clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.</p>

<p>Objective: Ensuring workers maintain social distancing guidelines (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable) wherever possible, including arriving at and departing from work, while in work and when travelling between sites.</p>
</div>

<p>You must maintain social distancing in the workplace wherever possible.</p>

<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity can be redesigned to maintain a 2m distance or 1m with risk mitigations where 2m is not viable.</p>

<p>Mitigating actions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning</li>
  <li>keeping the activity time involved as short as possible</li>
  <li>using screens or barriers to separate people from each other</li>
  <li>using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible</li>
  <li>reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using â€˜fixed teams or partneringâ€™ (so each person works with only a few others)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, even through redesigning a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between staff.</p>

<p>Social distancing applies to all parts of a business, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, canteens and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain social distancing and workers should be specifically reminded.</p>

<h2 id="personal-protective-equipment-ppe-and-face-coverings">6. Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) and face coverings</h2>

<p><strong>In this section</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#homes-6-1">6.1 Face coverings</a></li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks.</p>

<p>Where you are already using <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in your work activity to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, you should continue to do so.</p>

<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk in the workplace. This includes maintaining social distancing (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable). When managing the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, additional <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, for example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>: personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) plan</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>: cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to protect against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required, then you must provide this <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided must fit properly.</p>

<h3 id="homes-6-1">6.1 Face coverings</h3>

<p>There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect individuals and those around them from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isnâ€™t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPEused to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of <abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments.
Face coverings are mandatory on public transport and will be mandatory in a number of indoor premises from the 24 July 2020.</p>

<p>People are also encouraged to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where there are people they do not normally meet. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and before and after taking them off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Find further detail on when and where to wear face coverings.</a>.</p>

<p>Some people donâ€™t have to wear a face covering including for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">health, age or equality reasons</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and before and after removing it</li>
  <li>when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands</li>
  <li>change your face covering if it becomes damp or if youâ€™ve touched it</li>
  <li>continue to wash your hands regularly</li>
  <li>change and wash your face covering daily</li>
  <li>if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturerâ€™s instructions. If itâ€™s not washable, dispose of it carefully in your usual waste</li>
  <li>practise social distancing wherever possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<p>You can make face-coverings at home. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering">Find guidance on how to wear and make a face-covering on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
