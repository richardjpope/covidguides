<p>Seven steps to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Complete a COVID-19 risk assessment.</strong> Share it with all your staff. <a href="#shops-1-1">Find out how to do a risk assessment</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean more often.</strong> Increase how often you clean surfaces, especially those that are being touched a lot. Ask your staff and your customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask your customers to wear face coverings</strong> in any indoor space or where required to do so by law. That is especially important if your customers are likely to be around people they do not normally meet. Some exemptions apply. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Check when to wear one, exemptions, and how to make your own</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure everyone is social distancing.</strong> Make it easy for everyone to do so by putting up signs or introducing a one way system that your customers can follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase ventilation</strong> by keeping doors and windows open where possible and running ventilation systems at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take part in NHS Test and Trace</strong> by keeping a record of all your customers and audience members for 21 days. Display an official NHS QR code poster so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details. Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn people with coronavirus symptoms away</strong>. If a staff member (or someone in their household) or a customer has a persistent cough, a high temperature or has lost their sense of taste or smell, they should be isolating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Five more things you need to be aware of if you are a performing arts venue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Take proactive steps to encourage audiences to support the safety of the event.</strong> Discourage activities which can create aerosol (such as shouting, chanting and singing along), seat individuals rather than allowing them to stand to help maintain social distancing, clearly communicate that individuals who should be isolating should not attend, and provide information on how the event will run.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Limit the number of audience members</strong> so that capacity is at a level that allows social distancing to be maintained. Venues will need to ensure that groups of up to 6 in the audience  (depending on Local Covid Alert Level restrictions) are kept separate from one another to ensure they do not mix and do not exceed the new legal limits. To note, depending on Local Covid Alert Level restrictions groups from the same support bubble (i.e. 1 household or 2 linked households) may exceed 6 and therefore sit together.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Limit the number of performers as far as possible and use teams, groups or partnering</strong> to reduce the number of people individuals have contact with, for example, where social distancing may be impractical (such as intimate or fighting scenes in theatre, dancing, costume fitting, hair and make-up).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Limit the duration of opportunities for social interaction</strong> as far as possible, including rehearsals and performances.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Encourage working outdoors</strong> and refer to <a rel="external" href="https://www.eventsindustryforum.co.uk/index.php/11-features/14-keeping-workers-and-audiences-safe-during-covid-19">outdoor events</a> guidance if you’re organising outdoor activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the priority actions to make your business safe during coronavirus. You should also read the full version of the guidance below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Latest updates</strong></p>

<p>Performing Arts venues across all Local Covid Alert Levels will not be required to close, however local authorities in Very High Alert Level areas may decide that they should close where agreed. Venues located in very high alert level areas should check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know#local-covid-alert-level-very-high">specific rules for their areas.</a></p>

<p>We have updated this guidance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation that temporary restrictions will continue to be placed on the operating hours of certain businesses (hospitality, entertainment and leisure venues). Cinemas, theatres and concert halls will normally have to close at 10pm, but will be permitted to stay open to finish a show or performance that started before 10pm; they will not however be permitted to serve food or drink to customers after 10pm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that cinemas, theatres and concert halls will be mandated to either collect Test and Trace data or display the QR code for the Test and Trace App. See section 1.3 for more details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that professional activity in line with Stage 4 of the performing arts roadmap can continue as it has done previously</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that for adults, organised exercise classes can still take place in groups larger than 6  (depending on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level restrictions</a>). When participating in any activity like this, you should not mingle in groups of more than 6 (in Local Covid Alert Level: Medium areas) or your household and support bubble (in High and Very High areas). You should always ensure you socially distance from people you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that the limit on gatherings does not apply to professionals taking place in performing arts activity. The Cabinet Office has published guidance confirming the exceptions here, for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-medium">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-high">High</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-very-high">Very High</a> areas, which include workplace settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that in Medium Local Covid Alert Level areas it is <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/684">against the law</a> to gather in groups of more than 6, unless everyone is from the same households or support bubble. In High and Very High areas, it is against the law to gather indoors in groups which do not consist only of the same household and support bubble. A number of exemptions apply. For example, some activities - such as those organised for under-18s including education or training supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care, youth groups and activities,  - are exempt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that in a COVID-secure venue or public outdoor place, non-professional performing arts activity, including choirs, orchestras or drama groups can continue to rehearse or perform together where this is planned activity in line with the performing arts guidance and if they can do so in a way that ensures that there is no interaction between separate and distinct groups of no more than 6 (In Medium areas and outdoors) or individual households (in High and Very High areas). If an amateur group is not able to ensure that no mingling takes place between these sub-groups (depending on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level restrictions</a>) - including when arriving at or leaving activity or in any breaks or socialising - then such non-professional activity should not take place. See Local Covid Alert Level guidance (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-medium">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-high">High</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-very-high">Very High</a>) for more details on group size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that from Wednesday 14 October theatres, concert halls and cinemas in Medium and High local Covid alert levels will be exempt from requiring people to be seated whilst ordering food and drink (including alcohol). They will not be permitted to serve food or drink to customers after 10pm. The sale of alcohol for consumption at premises in Very High alert level areas must cease - unless served for consumption as part of a substantial meal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that it is a requirement to remind customers of the need to wear face coverings unless exempt, for example through prominent display of signs, and/or verbal reminders to customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that by law in England staff who are likely to come into contact with customers and customers in indoor hospitality must wear a face covering (apart from when customers are eating or/drinking).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that performers, performing in the course of their employment or in the course of providing their services (for example during rehearsals and performances), are exempt from wearing face coverings; they must, however be worn at all other points whilst in a venue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmed that office workers who can work effectively from home should do so over the winter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clarified how 1m+ social distancing can be implemented.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical that employers, employees, the self-employed, volunteers and non-professionals take steps to keep everyone safe. This document is to help performing arts organisations, venue operators and participants including those who are employers, employees and self-employed, volunteers and non-professionals in the UK understand how to work and take part in the performing arts safely, and keep their audiences safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping as many people as possible 2m apart from those they do not live with.</p>

<p>This document includes guidance for a return to training and rehearsal, and managing audiences and venues or premises, in line with the law and current social distancing advice. We understand how important it is that you can work safely and support your employees’ and customers’ health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic and not contribute to the spread of the virus. Evidence on the most effective steps that can be taken to limit the transmission of the virus continues to be regularly reviewed. This guidance may be updated in the future in response to changing scientific understanding.</p>

<p>We have developed a five-stage roadmap to bring our performing arts back safely. These five stages of the phased return to performing arts are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Stage One</strong> - Rehearsal and training (no audiences)</li>
  <li>
<strong>Stage Two</strong> - Performances for broadcast and recording purposes</li>
  <li>
<strong>Stage Three</strong> - Performances outdoors with an audience and pilots for indoor performances with a limited socially-distanced audience</li>
  <li>
<strong>Stage Four</strong> - Performances allowed indoors and outdoors (but with a limited socially-distanced audience indoors)</li>
  <li>
<strong>Stage Five</strong> - Performances allowed indoors / outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors)</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance sets out how performing arts organisations can prepare for and deliver their activities at each of these five stages. This means that not all the guidance set out here will be relevant immediately; organisations should adopt the guidelines insofar as the government permits activities to proceed. Where a premises or venue delivers a mix of services, only those services that are permitted to be open should be available.</p>

<p>As of 15 August we are now at Stage Four of the roadmap. This means that socially distanced indoor and outdoor performances can take place in line with this guidance, though we encourage organisations to continue to work outdoors wherever possible. In addition, musicians, dancers and actors, and the technical and operational teams that support performing arts production, can resume training, rehearsals and recorded performances where organisations wish and are able to. Dance studios are also open and should follow guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities">providers of grassroots sport and gym/leisure facilities</a>. As set out in more detail in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy/the-next-chapter-in-our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy--2">the government’s roadmap for recovery</a> any further steps to continue to open up the economy will be dependent on the state of the epidemic at the time and the trajectory of cases being stable or remaining in decline.</p>

<p>As of 14 September activity in line with Stage 4 of the performing arts roadmap can continue. Venues such as theatres, concert halls and other entertainment venues that are already able to host larger numbers, and are COVID-secure in line with the relevant guidance, will continue to be able to do so - as long as groups of more than one household are limited to 6 and social distancing is maintained between them.</p>

<p>Both professionals and non-professionals (meaning those participating in performing arts other than for work purposes), or groups which include non-professionals, should refer to this guidance for their activities, although they should note that different guidance and rules apply to professionals and non-professionals. . Organisations have a duty of care to volunteers and non-professionals to ensure as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. This guidance around working safely during COVID-19 should ensure that volunteers and non-professionals are afforded the same level of protection to their health and safety as employees and the self-employed. This guidance also sets out how organisations will want to think about managing audiences.</p>

<p>Additional mitigations, such as extended social distancing, were previously required for singing, wind and brass given concerns that these were potentially higher risk activities. DCMS commissioned further scientific studies to be carried out to develop the scientific evidence on these activities, which has allowed us to reconsider appropriate mitigations. Both professionals and non-professionals can now engage in singing, wind and brass in line with this guidance. People should continue to socially distance from those they do not live with wherever possible. Venues, performers and audiences should ensure 2m distancing applies wherever possible.</p>

<p>However, these studies have indicated that it is the cumulative aerosol transmission from both those performing in and attending events that is likely to create risk. We are continuing to develop more detailed understanding of how to mitigate this potential aggregate risk, but in that context, organisations should therefore consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining social distancing wherever possible. Non-professionals should not engage in activities that may lead to social distancing being compromised,  including not engaging in activities where there is a risk of mixing between separate and distinct groups of no more than 6 people  at Medium alert level areas, and distinct groups of different households in High and Very High areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring activity takes place outside wherever possible, including performance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limiting the number of performers as far as possible (with non-professionals being restricted by rules on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting with others safely</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limiting the number of audience members, noting that capacity should be maintained at a level that allows social distancing to be maintained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limiting the duration of social interaction opportunities (eg. rehearsals or performances) as far as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking steps to improve ventilation as far as possible and whenever possible, both through the use of mechanical systems and opening windows and doors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking steps to encourage audiences to support the overall safety of the event, including discouraging activities which can create aerosol (such as shouting, chanting and singing along), seating individuals rather than allowing them to stand (to help maintain social distancing) and the other mitigations outlined in this guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to take the other vital steps outlined in this guidance, including preventing unwell people from attending, maintaining cleanliness, supporting contact tracing and other mitigating measures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By considering and adopting these measures cumulatively, the overall risk of the event will be reduced.</p>

<p>Organisations must ensure an appropriate COVID-19 risk assessment is carried out and that the numbers of individuals involved are able to be socially distanced at all times. Organisations and venues will want to minimise the risk as far as possible and this guidance sets out a number of mitigations that should be considered when doing so. See the bullets above and section 3 for further details.</p>

<p>We hope this guidance gives you freedom within a practical framework to think about what you need to do to continue, or restart, operations and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We understand how important it is to work safely and support your workers’, volunteers’ and participants’ health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic and not contribute to the spread of the virus. The government is clear that workers should not be forced into an unsafe workplace and the health and safety of workers and participants, and public health, should not be put at risk.</p>

<p>This document has been prepared by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) in consultation with representatives of the performing arts sector, Public Health England (PHE) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).</p>

<p>Public health is devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; this guidance should be considered alongside local public health and safety requirements and legislation in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For advice to organisations in other parts of the UK please see guidance set by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government, and the Welsh Government. While this guidance applies to England, you should always consider whether there are local restrictions in place in your area. If you live or work in an area that is experiencing a local COVID-19 outbreak and where local restrictions have been imposed, different guidance and legislation will apply. Please consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">local restrictions pages</a> to see if any restrictions are in place in your area.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of pilots of socially distanced indoor performances in July, this guidance has been updated with additional measures and clarifications arising from how these performances were managed. We expect that this document will continue to be updated over time. Readers should take particular note of changes in relation to track and trace, face coverings and managing audiences.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-this-guidance">How to use this guidance</h3>

<p>This document sets out guidance on how to train, rehearse, perform and manage audiences safely while minimising the risk of spreading COVID-19. It gives practical considerations of how this can be applied in performing arts workplaces and environments. This guidance only relates to activities permitted by government regulation.</p>

<p>Each organisation, self-employed person or participant will need to translate this guidance into the specific actions it needs to take, depending on the nature of their business or activity, including the size and type of organisation, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as an organisation or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors, volunteers, participants and other people, as well as your employees. </p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take, you need to carry out an appropriate COVID-19 risk assessment, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. As part of this risk assessment, you should understand and take into account the particular circumstances of those with different protected characteristics, such as those who are hearing or visually impaired.</p>

<p>This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers. </p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-performing-arts-returning-to-training-rehearsal-and-performance">What do we mean by ‘performing arts returning to training, rehearsal and performance’?</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to those who engage in activities in the performing arts including but not limited to performers (actors, singers, dancers, musicians, other performers), coaches, support workers, choreographers, costume designers, set builders, accompanists, directors, stage managers and other creative, technical and operational production team members; and to the premises and venues in which performing arts activities take place. It applies to training, rehearsal and pre-production activities, and performances which take place with or without a live audience, wherever these activities occur.</p>

<p>This guidance is likely to be relevant and should be considered in a wide range of circumstances including but not limited to: <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukmusic.org/covid-19/guidance/">music production</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://britishfilmcommission.org.uk/guidance/regarding-covid-19-coronavirus/">film</a>, advertising, <a rel="external" href="https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/tv-production-guidance-managing-the-risk-of-coronavirus-in-production-making-v1.pdf">television production</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july">places of worship</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.eventsindustryforum.co.uk/index.php/11-features/14-keeping-workers-and-audiences-safe-during-covid-19">outdoor events and festivals</a>, indoor unseated music venues, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery#takeaways-4-5">bars and restaurants</a>. Where relevant, it should be read alongside the specific guidance relevant to particular settings. In particular, learning professionals in the performing arts should look at guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak">out-of-school settings</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance contains information that is relevant both for those working in the professional performing arts, those who participate in the performing arts on a non-professional basis, and for the owners, operators and users or hirers of premises or venues when they are used for performing arts. Recognising that within the performing arts it is common practice to operate both in your own and in third parties’ premises or venues, and to hire equipment from third parties, collaboration between groups, organisations and businesses will likely be needed to give proper effect to this guidance.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">government guidance</a>. It will be updated regularly as government advice changes, so please ensure you are working from the latest version.</p>

<h3 id="social-distancing-in-performing-arts-environments">Social distancing in performing arts environments</h3>

<p>From 28 September, it is a requirement for venues and organisers to ensure compliance with the rule of 6, and ensure appropriate social distancing, through signage, layout, ventilation and entry numbers management.</p>

<p>Everyone should follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting with others safely</a>. Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart you should stay more than 1 metre apart, as well as taking extra steps to stay safe. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wear a face covering: In England, you must wear a face covering in the following indoor settings. The latest list can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">here</a>
</li>
  <li>move outdoors, where it is safer and there is more space</li>
  <li>if indoors, make sure rooms are well ventilated by keeping windows and doors open</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="professionals-operating-under-the-performing-arts-guidance">Professionals operating under the performing arts guidance</h4>

<p>You must maintain social distancing in the performing arts environment wherever possible. Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full in relation to a particular professional activity, organisations should consider whether that activity needs to continue, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between staff, workers, participants and audiences. Mitigating actions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Further increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keeping the activity time involved as short as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using back-to-back or side-to-side positioning (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reducing the number of people each person has contact with by considering the use of ‘fixed teams, groups or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others). For example, where social distancing may be impractical due to the degree of proximity required (such as intimate/fighting scenes in theatre, dancing, costume fitting, hair and make-up), fixed teams could be operated as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Grouping individuals into fixed teams that work together throughout a production or project or for specific periods to minimise the risk of transmission beyond these fixed teams</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Minimising transmission risk between fixed teams when they mix outside their team during a rehearsal or performance and during breaks or moving around a premises or venue</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensuring that there is no swapping between designated fixed teams. This is to reduce the risk of whole team impact in the event of a worker contracting COVID-19</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Including any support workers for disabled workers or performers as a member of the fixed team</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Note that it is unlikely that this fixed team approach will be possible in non-professional environments or where professional performers work with more than one group or organisation simultaneously</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using screens where feasible to separate individuals or fixed teams from each other where they cannot achieve social distancing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Social distancing applies to all parts of a premises or venue, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, dressing rooms, canteens, foyers and bars, and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain social distancing. Assessing the capacity of any space to be used and appropriately managing this to maintain social distancing.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: That all employers and organisation carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment.</p>
</div>

<p>COVID-19 is a public health emergency. Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19 and in particular organisations should consider the risks to their workers, participants and any audience. As a performing arts organisation, an employer or as an operator of a premises or venue, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers, volunteers, audience members, users and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the risk assessment for your organisation and the places where you operate addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures, and taking account of the needs of those with protected characteristics. You should also consider the security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place, as any revisions could present new or altered security risks that may require mitigation. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your environment. If you have fewer than five workers or participants, or are self-employed, you don’t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work</a> along with <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/working-safely-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm">specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces</a>.</p>

<p>Employers and organisations have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work or activity are often the best people to understand the risks in that environment and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>At its most effective, full involvement of your workers or participants creates a culture where relationships between employers/organisations and workers/participants are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers and participants should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of health and safety policies in partnership with the employer or organisation.</p>

<p>Employers or organisations and their workers or participants should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.</p>

<p>Additional mitigations, such as extended social distancing, were previously required for singing, wind and brass given concerns that these were potentially higher risk activities. DCMS commissioned further scientific studies to develop the scientific evidence on these activities, which has allowed us to reconsider these additional mitigations. Both professionals and non-professionals can now engage in singing, wind and brass in line with this guidance. People should continue to socially distance from those they do not live with wherever possible. Venues, performers and audiences should ensure 2m distancing applies wherever possible.</p>

<p>However, these studies have indicated that it is the cumulative aerosol transmission from both those performing in and attending events that is likely to create risk. We are continuing to develop more detailed understanding of how to mitigate this potential aggregate risk, but in that context, organisations should therefore consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining social distancing wherever possible. Non-professionals should not engage in activities that may lead to social distancing being compromised.</li>
  <li>Ensuring activity takes place outside wherever possible, including performance</li>
  <li>Limiting the number of performers as far as possible with non-professionals being restricted by guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting with others safely</a>.

<h3 id="shops-1-1">1.1 Managing risk</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority.</p>
</div>

<p>Employers or organisations have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers or organisations must work with any other employers, organisations or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s health and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means protecting the health and safety of your workers, participants and any audience by working through these steps in order:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>2 metres, wherever possible, or 1 metre with robust risk mitigation (where 2 metres is not viable), are acceptable. You should consider and set out the mitigations you will introduce in your risk assessment. (Mitigation does not include basic measures such as good hand and respiratory hygiene, the compliance with which should be universal and is assumed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting with others safely</a>. Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart you should stay more than 1 metre apart, as well as taking extra steps to stay safe. For example: <br><br>– wear a face covering: In England, you must wear a face covering in most indoor settings. The latest guidance can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">here</a> <br><br>– move outdoors, where it is safer and there is more space <br><br>– if indoors, make sure rooms are well ventilated by keeping windows and doors open</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to ensure their employees can work safely. From 1 August 2020, this may be working from home, or within the workplace if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. When in the workplace, everyone should make every reasonable effort to comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social distancing guidelines set out by the government</a> (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, organisations should consider whether that activity needs to continue for it to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff, participants and visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further mitigating actions include: <br><br> – increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning, including disinfection of high footfall areas or common touchpoints with particular attention to toilets/restrooms.<br><br>– keeping the activity time of any activity where social distancing cannot be maintained as short as possible <br><br>– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other <br><br>– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible <br><br>– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the security implications of any changes you intend to make to your operations and practices in response to COVID-19, as any revisions may present new or altered security risks which may need mitigations.
Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe environment.</p>

<p>In your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people undertaking the activity are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you must consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trades unions.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the risks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace or environment as soon as possible. If you are currently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this thinking already. We recommend that you use this document to identify any further improvements you should make.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of COVID-19, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of COVID-19, could constitute a breach of health and safety law. The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to two years. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against COVID-19 by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p>Please remember that when a building or space is repurposed - when there is any change in use or type or use or other circumstance - there needs to be a fire risk assessment.</p>

<h3 id="shops-1-2">1.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You must share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, you should consider publishing the results on your website (and we would expect all businesses with over 50 workers to do so).</p>

<p>We would expect all businesses to demonstrate to their workers and customers that they have properly assessed their risk and taken appropriate measures to mitigate this. You should do this by displaying a notification in a prominent place in your business and on your website, if you have one.</p>

<p>Below you will find a notice you should display in your workplace to show you have followed this guidance.</p>

<div class="form-download">

</div>

<p>There may also be other industry standards or marks that you can use to demonstrate to any visitors, guests and customers that you have thought carefully about risk.</p>

<h3 id="shops-1-3">1.3 Test and trace</h3>

<p>From Wednesday 14 October cinemas, theatres and concert halls will be mandated to either collect Test and Trace data or display the QR code for the Test and Trace App.</p>

<p>Organisations and venues are mandated to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people or a household or support bubble depending on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level restrictions</a>) to provide their name and contact details.</li>
  <li>keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested</li>
  <li>display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details</li>
  <li>adhere to General Data Protection Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, venues will be required to ensure that anyone visiting provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS QR code before being allowed entry to the venue</p>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these rules will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these rules to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open</p>

<p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks</p>

<p>You can find out more about these requirements <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, venues may also record where audience members are seated to aid the process.</p>

<p>Objective: Employers should ensure workplaces are safe whilst also enabling working from home.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to keep the virus under control, it is important that people work safely. Working from home remains one way to do this. However, the risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 Secure guidelines are followed closely.</p>

<p>To help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so over the winter.  Where an employer, in consultation with their employee, judges an employee can carry out their normal duties from home they should do so. Public sector employees working in essential services should continue to go into work where necessary. Anyone else who cannot work from home should go to their place of work. The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely.  Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.</p>

<p>Employers should consult with their employees to determine who could come into the workplace safely, taking account of a person’s journey, childcare responsibilities, protected characteristics, and other individual circumstances. Businesses should consider the impact of workplace reopening on local transport, and take appropriate mitigating actions (e.g. staggered start and finish times for staff). When it is decided that workers can come into their place of work then this will need to be reflected in the COVID-19 risk assessment and actions taken to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance. It is vital employers engage with workers to ensure they feel safe returning to work, and they must not force anyone into an unsafe workplace.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To ensure social distancing is possible by limiting the number of people able to access the premises or venue.</p>
</div>

<p>Maximum capacity should consider appropriate social distancing given the nature of activities (i.e. if the activity is static vs. requiring a range of movement) and equipment layout and the configuration of space.</p>

<p>Follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">meeting with others safely</a>. Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart you should stay more than 1 metre apart, as well as taking extra steps to stay safe. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wear a face covering: In England, you must wear a face covering in most indoor settings. The latest guidance can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">here</a>.</li>
  <li>move outdoors, where it is safer and there is more space</li>
  <li>if indoors, make sure rooms are well ventilated by keeping windows and doors open</li>
</ul>

<p>Maximum capacity should consider appropriate social distancing given the nature of activities (i.e. if the activity is static vs. requiring a range of movement) and equipment layout and the configuration of space.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be given to ventilation and sufficient circulation space especially around equipment and between groups and any classes and coaches or teachers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Conducting a specific risk assessment for each premises or venue and the proposed activities to identify: <br><br>– The likely numbers of people that will be in the venue or on the premises at different times of its use <br>– The number of people that can reasonably follow social distancing within the venue or premises, taking into account total space, equipment as well as likely constraints (toilets and washrooms) and pinch points <br>– The ventilation rates that can be applied to the premises or venue and whether this can be adjusted sufficiently to deliver a safe environment for all those due to attend at any time (performers, producers, support teams and audience combined) <br>– Which activities can be undertaken and which spaces can be used with specific measures to ensure social distancing and maintain cleaning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the number of people in the venue or on the premises, overall and in any particular congestion areas, for example doorways between outside and inside spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling a booking system or other approaches to manage demand of spaces, so that no more than the desired number of people are in the building at any one time and records of those attending, including seating position, can be provided for contact tracing purposes in the event of a case of Covid-19 in a participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing occupancy levels and changeover by reducing class, rehearsal group or audience sizes and amending timetabling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing a sufficient break time between sessions or performances held to prevent waiting in groups.</p>

<li>
<p>Where possible, operating on a book-in-advance basis for any spaces available to hire, preferably online or over the phone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="arts-3-2">3.2 Staging and capacity</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To ensure that the size of audience, the arrangements and performances staged are consistent with ensuring social distancing.</p>
</div>

<p>Risk assessments should specifically consider the maximum capacity for a given performance, the ventilation that can be delivered for that capacity and the ability to manage audience behaviour to avoid compromising social distancing.</p>

<p>People living in households and groups should always remain socially distanced from each other (your support bubble counts as one household).</p>

<p>Social distancing should be maintained at 2m as far as possible (see section 3.1 above), but this can be reduced to 1m where 2m is unviable and where other mitigations are in place e.g. audience members wearing face coverings.</p>

<p>When seated in rows this means that social distancing should always be observed side-to-side with space left between households and groups up to a maximum of 6 people. Where seating allows, it is also advised that social distancing should be applied nose-to-nose i.e. maintaining 1m between seats front and behind.</p>

<p>However, in an auditorium setting with fixed seats at under 1m front-to-back, audience members can continue to be seated in each row, provided face coverings are worn and other measures in this guidance are being followed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Reducing site, premises or venue capacity and limiting ticket sales to a volume which ensures social distancing can be maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For performances or events where there is no ticketing, considering using other communications approaches, coupled with stewarding, to manage the numbers attending. Free, open, unticketed and unfenced performances or events will need to demonstrate a reasonable approach to control numbers if too many people begin to arrive and to encourage social distancing, as well as fulfilling requirements to support contact tracing in the event of a subsequent case of Covid-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing performance scheduling so that audiences for different performances are not using the site, premises or venue at the same time in a way that compromises adherence to social distancing, and to allow for adequate cleaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconfiguring entertainment spaces to enable audience to be seated rather than standing. For example, repurposing ticketed standing areas as ticketed seating areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering using available spaces outdoors for performances with a live audience in attendance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the expected interactions amongst audience members and making sure sufficient controls are in place to maintain social distancing, for example providing clear communication, demarcating spaces, using sufficient ushers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure risk assessments carefully consider worker safety, especially of those working closely with a large number of members of the public or audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discouraging or avoiding gatherings such as performances or screenings that may encourage audience behaviours that increase transmission risk, for example crowding, clustering or physical contact outside of household groups or support bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering where crowding could take place such as at points of ingress and egress, car parking, handwashing and toilet facilities, waiting areas, bars and restaurants and areas in proximity to performance area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the particular needs of disabled audiences when making adjustments to venues or premises, and communicating these appropriately before any performance as well as when in the venue or premises.</p>

<h3 id="arts-3-3">3.3 Managing audiences</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To maintain social distancing wherever possible in performing arts environments.</p>
</div>

<p>People should continue to socially distance from those they do not live with wherever possible. They should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level</a> rules for their area on group size.</p>

<p>Households and groups up to a maximum of 6 people (depending on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level restrictions</a>) should always remain socially distanced from each other (your support bubble counts as one household) in any location. See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-people-from-outside-your-household-from-4-july#making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">making a support bubble with another household</a>. From 14 September  it is against the law for gatherings of more than 6 people (depending on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Local Covid Alert Level restrictions</a>) to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces).</p>

<p>Organisations and venues must ensure an appropriate COVID-19 risk assessment is carried out and that individuals are socially distanced at all times. Organisations and venues will want to minimise the risk as far as possible and this section of the guidance sets out a number of mitigations that should be considered when doing so.</p>

<p>In particular, those operating venues or running events following COVID-19 Secure guidelines should take additional steps to ensure the safety of the public and prevent large gatherings or mass events from taking place. Venues should take account of this guidance and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation/guidance-for-providers-of-outdoor-facilities-on-the-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation#reopening-your-outdoors-sports-facility">outdoor events guidance</a> in organising outdoor performances. Individual businesses or venues should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. These could include:</p>

<p>▪	Further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue.</p>

<p>▪	Staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.</p>

<p>▪	Arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues.</p>

<p>▪	Advising patrons to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue.</p>

<p>Local authorities should avoid issuing licenses for events that could lead to larger gatherings forming and provide advice to businesses on how to manage events of this type. If appropriate, the government has powers under Schedule 22 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 to close venues hosting large gatherings or prohibit certain events (or types of event) from taking place.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>When members of the public are attending performances, organisers should ensure that steps are taken to avoid audiences needing to unduly raise their voices to each other, such as shouting, chanting and singing along. This is because increased volume can increase aerosol transmission.</p>
</div>

<p>This includes, but is not limited to, discouraging singing along to music or cheering, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, including if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult, for example during performance intervals. Organisers can ask performers to help encourage the audience to support the overall safety of the event. You should take similar steps to prevent close contact activities - such as communal dancing in audiences.</p>

<p>This is important to mitigate the potential for increased risk of transmission - particularly from droplets and aerosol transmission. We will develop further guidance, based on scientific evidence, to enable these activities as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="arts-3-4">3.4 Outdoor performances</h3>

<p>Organisers of outdoor performances should give particular consideration to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The guidance on delivering <a rel="external" href="https://www.eventsindustryforum.co.uk/index.php/11-features/14-keeping-workers-and-audiences-safe-during-covid-19">outdoor events</a>, particularly where such performances are not typical to their operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of drive-in performances, only allowing cars to park sufficiently far apart to ensure social distancing is maintained, for example by clearly marking available parking spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ingress and egress management, car parking, public transport, hand washing facilities and areas such as arenas, stages or concessions points where crowding could take place. Requirements for permanent structures will differ from green field sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consulting with the relevant authorities and seeking specialist advice to best evaluate impact, developing mitigating strategies and coordinating relevant external agencies if required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Managing family groups who may wish to remain closer than the required social distance but who, in doing so, may encourage others to cluster in a similar manner. Communication is key to this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where items are offered for customer use, so for example a picnic blanket or seating, this should be done only where they can be collected from an appropriate distance and with hygiene measures in place (for example, through the availability of hand sanitiser). Such items should be thoroughly cleaned before being offered for re-use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning car parking to allow sufficient spacing for the social distancing of occupants. This will be particularly important at events where attendees may gather around their vehicles during an event or make frequent visits to their vehicles to collect chairs, coats, drinks etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with symptoms of COVID-19, or who have been advised to self-isolate following contact with someone with symptoms of COVID-19, should be asked not to attend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expected interactions among participants occurring during the event and implementing sufficient controls to ensure social distancing is maintained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discouraging or avoiding activities or features that are likely to encourage audience behaviours increasing transmission risk, such as crowding, clustering, communal dancing and physical contact outside of household groups or support bubbles.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Adapting performance scheduling to support social distancing and good hygiene. For example, scheduling sufficient time between performances to reduce the possibility of different audiences coming into close proximity and to allow time for cleaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using space outside the site, premises or venue for queuing where available and safe. Outside queues should be managed to make sure they do not cause a risk to individuals, other businesses or additional security risks, for example by introducing queuing systems, having staff direct visitors or audience, and protecting queues from traffic by routing them behind permanent physical structures such as street furniture, bike racks, bollards or putting up barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with your local authority or landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, for example queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing instances where people might be required to queue. For example, at: <br><br> – Entrances and exits to the building <br> – Escalators, stairs and lifts <br> – Ticket and concessions kiosks and ticket validation points <br> – Entrances and exits to auditoria, and <br> – Toilets and washrooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where possible, designating staff to manage queues and regulate guest access between areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging visitors to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the site, premises or venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using queue management and marking out one-way flow systems through the site, premises or venue to reduce contact points. For example, introduce one-way systems through the common areas, using auditorium fire exits as the standard so that guests are not required to pass each other when entering and exiting these spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping visitors maintain social distancing by placing clearly visible markers along the ground, floor or walls, advising on appropriate spacing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering how social distancing markers can be made as accessible as reasonably practicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring any changes to entry, exit and queue management take into account reasonable adjustments for those who need them, including disabled visitors. For example, maintaining pedestrian and parking access for disabled customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extra stewarding/marshalling may be needed at key pinch points and care should be taken to remove any barriers at exits that might cause crowding. This should be considered as part of the event’s crowd management plan, in consultation with those responsible for managing security and marshalling etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of crowd density points, such as where people stop to watch displays, must be considered as part of this planning to ensure social distancing can be maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the potential for guest contact with performers and support staff by, for example: <br><br> – Using theatre security to keep stage door areas clear before and after a performance to allow performers and other staff to enter and exit safely <br> – Not permitting visitors backstage <br> – Not permitting autograph signing or photographs with performers</p>

<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full in relation to a particular activity, organisations should consider whether that activity needs to continue, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between staff, workers, participants and audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some productions may require costume fitting where social distancing and avoidance of intimate face-to-face contact is impractical. In these instances, consider:  <br><br> – Using screened-off cubicles for cast to receive their costume and dress without assistance where possible.

  <li><a href="#arts-6-2">6.2 Face Coverings</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="arts-6-1">6.1 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and face coverings</h3>

<p>PPE protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks.</p>

<p>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so.</p>

<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you should take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/5-steps-to-working-safely">recommended distance away</a> from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.</p>

<p>The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE, for example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan">COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, then you should provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided should fit properly. Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3 id="arts-6-2">6.2 Face Coverings</h3>

<p>From 28 September it is a requirement to remind customers of the need to wear face coverings unless exempt, for example through prominent display of signs, and/or verbal reminders to customers.</p>

<p>Face coverings must be worn in entertainment venues, including theatres and concert halls. By law from 24 September in England staff who are likely to come into contact with customers and customers in indoor hospitality must wear a face covering (apart from when customers are eating or drinking).</p>

<p>From 24 September, performers must wear a face covering at all times other than when in the course of their employment or in the course of providing their services (for example during rehearsals and performances).</p>
