<h2 id="priority-actions-to-take---what-businesses-need-to-do-to-protect-staff-and-customers">Priority actions to take - what businesses need to do to protect staff and customers</h2>

<p>Seven steps to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Complete a COVID-19 risk assessment.</strong> Share it with all your staff. <a href="#chapter1">Find out how to do a risk assessment</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean more often.</strong> Increase how often you clean surfaces, especially those that are being touched a lot. Ask your staff and your customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask your customers to wear face coverings</strong> indoors or where required to do so by law. That is especially important if your customers are likely to be around people they do not normally meet. Face coverings are not required when exercising. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Find out about other exemptions and all places where customers must wear face coverings must be worn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure everyone is social distancing.</strong> Make it easy for everyone to do so by putting up signs or introducing a one way system that your customers can follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase ventilation</strong> by keeping doors and windows open where possible and running ventilation systems at all times. Indoor facilities must limit maximum occupancy by providing a minimum of 100 square feet per person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take part in NHS Test and Trace</strong> by keeping a record of all your customers for 21 days. From 18 September, this will be enforced in law. Some exemptions apply. Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn people with coronavirus symptoms away</strong>. If a staff member (or someone in their household) or a customer has a persistent cough, a high temperature or has lost their sense of taste or smell, they should be isolating.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Five more things to be aware of if you run a sports facility, gym or leisure centre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Check whether a sport can be played indoors.</strong> There is separate guidance for each sport. Check with the sport’s national governing body. Find the national governing body for each sport on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/national-governing-bodies?section=the_recognition_process">UK Sport website</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Engage with returning visiting instructors and volunteers.</strong> Work with instructors to understand the number of facilities they visit and set up a monitoring system. Consult with volunteers to understand their responsibilities and provide relevant training material to help them return to a facility or sport.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Limit the use of changing rooms</strong> by encouraging customers to arrive in sports kit and, where possible, to travel home to change. Changing rooms should be used as quickly as possible. Facilities should always be available for those with disabilities.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Encourage contactless payments.</strong> Whenever possible, use online booking and pre-payment and ask for contactless payments.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Understand how your business interacts with the local area.</strong> Limit risk by reducing queues on the street outside, staggering check in times and opening hours to other businesses, and advising customers to avoid particular forms of transport at busy times or routes to avoid crowded areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the priority actions to make your business safe during coronavirus, you should also read the full version of the guidance below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Latest updates</strong></p>

<p>New rules mandate that people cannot gather in groups of more than 6 people, unless exemptions apply. On 22 September, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-what-has-changed-22-september">further measures</a> were announced, including reducing the list of exemptions to the ‘rule of 6’ to limit the risk of transmission through social contact.</p>

<p>From 24 September, the following guidance applies:</p>

<p>●	Organised indoor team sport is no longer exempt from the rule of 6. This means that organised indoor team sport should only take place in groups of up to 6 people (unless an exemption or easement applies). There is an exemption for indoor sport for people with disabilities, so this can continue in any number as long as undertaken in line with published COVID-secure guidance.</p>

<p>●	Other organised indoor sport, including indoor exercise classes, can continue to take place with larger numbers present, provided that participants are in separate and distinct groups of up to 6 people (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble) which do not mix with other groups. If separate groups are likely to mix, these indoor activities should not go ahead.</p>

<p>●	Organised outdoor team sport, outdoor exercise classes and outdoor licensed physical activity are still exempt from the rule of 6, and can happen in any number as long as undertaken in line with published COVID-secure guidance</p>

<p>●	All supervised activities for under-18s, including indoor and outdoor sports and exercise groups, are exempt (provided relevant guidance is followed and risk assessments carried out)</p>

<p>●	Social interaction before and after playing any sport should be limited and only take place in separate and distinct groups consisting of up to 6 people (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble)</p>

<p>●	Certain businesses are required to close between 10pm and 5am if they sell food or drinks. Sport facilities such as gyms, leisure centres and sport clubs are not required to close, however hospitality areas which sell food and drink (such as cafes and bars) must close at 10pm. This does not apply to dispensing machines such as vending or coffee machines. Delivery services and drive-through services can continue after 10pm, where applicable.</p>

<p>●	Where a sport facility sells food and drink to consume on site, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure that customers will only consume the food or drink once seated. Where a sport facility is licensed or contains premises which are licensed to sell or supply alcohol for consumption on the premises, all food and drink must also be ordered from, and served to, seated customers.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that:</p>

<p>•	From 23 September, guidance on the settings in which face coverings are required has been expanded. This does not include gyms, leisure centres and other sport facilities, however when not engaging in sport and physical activity visitors should be encouraged to wear masks in enclosed public areas where possible and practical. Staff in close contact services are required to wear a mask and a visor when providing services.</p>

<p>•	From 28 September, all businesses are required to remind customers to wear face masks where mandated</p>
</div>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical that employers, employees, the self-employed and customers take steps to keep everyone safe. This document is to help providers of physical activity, grassroots sport, gym/leisure facilities and activities, their representative bodies, clubs, their employees, volunteers and their customers in England, understand how to operate safely during the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping as many people as possible appropriately distanced from those they do not live with. This guidance only applies to permitted activities under regulation in effect. See further information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close">business closures</a>.</p>

<p>We know many people are also keen to return to or contribute to volunteering. Organisations have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. This guidance around working safely during COVID-19 should ensure that volunteers are afforded the same level of protection to their health and safety as others, such as workers and customers.</p>

<p>We hope it gives you freedom within a practical framework to think about what you need to do to continue, or restart, your sport and leisure activities and facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We understand how important it is to operate safely and support your workers’, customers’ and visitors’ health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic and not contribute to the spread of the virus. We know that many of these activities and businesses of this type are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close-guidance">currently prohibited by government regulation</a>. We hope this guidance will be useful for facility owners, operators, sports and leisure participants as they develop new ways of working or to help prepare for the time when they are able to reopen. The government is clear that workers and volunteers should not be forced into an unsafe workplace and the health and safety of workers and customers, and public health, should not be put at risk.</p>

<p>This document has been prepared by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) with input from ukactive, Sport England, the Sport and Recreation Alliance and National Governing Bodies of sport and in consultation with Public Health England (PHE) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).</p>

<p>Public health is devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; this guidance should be considered alongside local public health and safety requirements and legislation in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For advice to businesses and/or organisations in other parts of the UK please see guidance set by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Government, and the Welsh Government.</p>

<p>This document is one of a set of documents about how to play and work safely in different types of sport and leisure facilities. This one is designed to be relevant for providers of physical activity, grassroots sport, gym/leisure facilities and activities, their representative bodies, their employees and volunteers in England.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-guidance">How to use this guidance</h2>

<p>This document sets out guidance on how to work, operate and participate in sport and leisure activities safely while minimising the risk of spreading COVID-19. It gives practical considerations of how this can be applied in a gym/leisure facility or area of sport.</p>

<p>Each business and/or organisation will need to translate this into the specific actions it needs to take, depending on the nature of their business and/or organisation, including the size and type of business and/or organisation, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as a business and/or organisation or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors, customers, visitors and other people, as well as your employees and volunteers.</p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take, you need to carry out an appropriate COVID-19 risk assessment, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers and volunteers.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gymleisure-facilities">What do we mean by ‘providers of grassroots sport and gym/leisure facilities’?</h3>

<p>Providers and operators of space enabling the following activities and facilities may reopen if they are ready to do so and can do so safely, following public health guidance:</p>

<p>·       Indoor and outdoor sports courts</p>

<p>·       Indoor and outdoor gyms</p>

<p>·       Indoor and outdoor swimming and diving pools, including water parks</p>

<p>·       Other indoor and outdoor sporting activities (including but not limited to sports fields, rugby, football, hockey, cricket and other pitches, skate parks, climbing facilities, trampoline parks, boxing halls, horse stables and arenas, bowling lawns, golf courses, and snowsport facilities, watersports and sporting facilities, track and field facilities)</p>

<p>·       Skating rinks</p>

<p>·       Hot tubs, hydrotherapy pools, whirlpools, and spa pools</p>

<p>·       Saunas and steam rooms</p>

<p>This guidance does not apply to children’s playgrounds and soft play facilities.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance</a> issued by the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy relating to the operation of related working environments, for instance for offices, shops and branches, working outdoors and bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with any sport-specific guidance issued by your national governing body.</p>

<p>All supervised activities for under-18s, including indoor and outdoor sports and exercise groups, are exempt (provided relevant guidance is followed and risk assessments carried out). For activities regarding school aged children, this guidance should be read in conjunction with the relevant sports safeguarding guidance and any other relevant guidance provided by the Department for Education. This guidance does not supersede any guidance provided by the Department for Education.</p>

</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: That all employers and operators carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment.</p>
</div>

<p>COVID-19 is a public health emergency. Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19, and in particular businesses should consider the risks to their workers / volunteers and customers. As an employer or as an operator of sports or leisure facility, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers, volunteers, customers and users from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business and/or organisation addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. You should also consider the security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place, as any revisions could present new or altered security risks that may require mitigation. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than five workers, or are self-employed, you don’t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">guidance for business and/or organisation on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work</a> along with <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/working-safely-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm">specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces</a>.</p>

<p>Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of COVID-19, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of COVID-19, could constitute a breach of health and safety law. The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.</p>

<p>Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to two years. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed Premises.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against COVID-19 by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p><strong>How to raise a concern:</strong></p>

  <li>contact your employee representative</li>
  <li>contact your trade union if you have one</li>
  <li>contact HSE at:</li>

<h3 id="section-1-1">1.1. Managing risk</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority.</p>
</div>

<p>Employers and facility operators have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody’s health and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means protecting the health and safety of your workers/volunteers and customers by working through these steps in order:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to ensure their employees can work safely. This may be working from home, or within the workplace if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. When in the workplace, everyone should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses and/or organisations should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business and/or organisation to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further mitigating actions include: <br><br>– increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning<br>– keeping the activity time involved as short as possible <br>– using screens or barriers to separate people from each other <br>– using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible <br>– reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In your assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you must consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trades unions.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the risks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are currently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this thinking already. We recommend that you use this document to identify any further improvements you should make.</p>

<h3 id="section-1-2">1.2. Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You must share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, you should consider publishing the results on your website (and we would expect all employers with over 50 workers to do so). Below you will find a notice you should display in your workplace to show you have followed this guidance.</p>

<div class="form-download">

<ul>
  <li><a href="#section-2-1">2.1 Manage contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="#section-2-2">2.2 Providing and explaining available guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<p>From 28 September, there will be a legal requirement for certain settings to implement COVID-secure guidelines. This includes ensuring customers adhere to social distancing rules, and taking steps to prevent people meeting in groups larger than 6. This will apply to:</p>

<p>●	leisure and tourism services: including clubs providing team sporting activities, indoor sport and leisure centres, outdoor swimming pools and lidos</p>

<p>●	close physical contact services: such as sports and massage therapists</p>

<p>●	services provided in: community centres and village halls</p>

<p>Businesses are also required to ensure people wear face coverings where mandated. This means that premises will be fined where breaches of the guidance are identified.</p>

<p>Sports and gym/leisure facilities span many different simple and complex environments where careful risk assessment of both the venue and activity is required to manage social distancing and effective infection control. Particular attention will need to be paid to clients using hydrotherapy pools and assistance they may need in doing so.</p>

<p>Clear communication to participants, volunteers and workers is critical to ensure that they should take all reasonable measures to comply with social distancing and hygiene measures at all times, before, during and after physical activity.</p>

<p>Further information is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social distancing</a>.</p>

<p>All venues should encourage attendees to arrive at the facility in sports kit and, where possible, to travel home to change/shower. Use of changing rooms and showering facilities should in general be avoided where possible, although these must be available for participants with disabilities or special needs and are likely to be needed after swimming.</p>

<p>All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes - but is not limited to - refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, including if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol and droplet transmission.</p>

<p>Additional detail on social distancing and sports at grassroots and community level can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-phased-return-of-outdoor-sport-and-recreation">outdoor sport and recreation guidance</a>. Guidance set out here also applies to indoor activity.</p>

<h3 id="section-2-1">2.1. Manage contact</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To minimise contact with surfaces, workers/volunteers, other customers and contractors within facilities or while participating in sport and physical activity.</p>
</div>

<p>Primary control for minimising transmission through contact is through handwashing and sufficiently frequent washing and avoiding sharing of objects.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Informing customers and contractors of guidance about visiting the premises prior to and at the point of arrival (including information on websites, on booking forms and in entrance ways).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing handwashing and hand sanitiser and encouraging staff and customers to wash their hands regularly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contactless payments advisable throughout facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signage to ensure workers, staff and customers are aware of the need to avoid contact throughout a facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing doors open that can be safely left open where feasible (although noting ventilation requirements at 5.2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where possible, reducing the need to open other objects, for example lockers, storage compartments, trunks and drawers by making equipment that is permitted for use readily accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding paperwork being transferred by enabling such processes as bookings, rosters, ladders, etc. through online channels.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 id="manage-capacity-and-overcrowding">2.1.1. Manage capacity and overcrowding</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To ensure distancing is possible by limiting the number of customers able to access the facilities.</p>
</div>

<p>Maximum capacity should be based on the government requirement for social distancing, nature of activities (i.e. if the activity is static vs. requiring a range of movement) and equipment layout and the configuration of facilities. From 24 September, you should also take into account the ‘rule of 6’ which will apply to organised indoor team sport for adults. Participation in these activities (e.g. games and matches) should be limited to groups of up to 6 (not including anyone present in a work capacity or providing voluntary services, such as officials and coaches). These additional restrictions do not apply to team sports for people with disabilities, which can continue in any number. Organised outdoor team sport is also exempt from the rule of 6.</p>

<p>Other organised indoor sport and indoor exercise classes can continue to take place with larger numbers present, provided that participants are in separate and distinct groups of up to 6 people (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble) which do not mix with other groups. If separate groups are likely to mix, these indoor activities should not go ahead.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be given to ventilation and sufficient circulation space specially around equipment and between groups and classes and instructors.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Conducting a specific risk assessment for each facility and the proposed activities, in particular: <br><br>– Identify the number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing within the gym/leisure facility, taking into account total space, equipment as well as likely constraints  (toilets, locker areas, changing rooms and washrooms) and pinch points <br>–  Encourage attendees to arrive at the facility in sports kit and where possible to travel home to change/shower. Use of changing rooms and showering facilities should in general be avoided where possible, although these must be available for participants with disabilities or special needs and are likely to be needed after swimming. <br>– Activities and spaces that can be undertaken and specific measures to ensure social distancing and cleaning <br>– Additional needs of any customers with physical disabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the number of customers in the gym/leisure facility overall and in any particular congestion areas, for example doorways between outside and inside spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling a booking system or other approaches to managing demand, so that no more than the desired number of customers and staff are in the building at any one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying workers/volunteers as designated supervisors for each area of the sport or gym/leisure facility to ensure social distancing measures are being adhered to by customers. Workers and volunteers are exempt from the rule of 6 as it applies to organised indoor sport and indoor exercise classes, so they do not count towards group totals for those activities, but consideration should be given to ways to limit exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing occupancy levels and changeover by reducing class sizes and amending timetabling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing sufficient break time between classes held in studios to appropriately clean the studio and equipment, and to prevent waiting in groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where possible, operating on a book-in-advance basis. Online or over the phone is preferable.</p>

<p>From 28 September, there will be a legal requirement for certain settings to implement COVID secure guidelines (full list above). This includes ensuring customers adhere to social distancing rules, and taking steps to prevent people meeting in groups larger than 6.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Using signage such as ground markings or being creative with other objects to mark out required social distance to allow controlled flows of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using markings to guide staff and customers coming into or leaving the building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining process alternatives for entry/exit points where appropriate, for example, deactivating pass readers at turnstiles in favour of showing a pass to security personnel at a distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing congestion, for example, by having more entry points to the facility. If you have more than one door, consider having one for entering the building and one for exiting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing outside queues to ensure they do not cause a risk to individuals, other businesses or additional security risks, for example by introducing queuing systems, having staff direct customers and protecting queues from traffic by routing them behind permanent physical structures such as street furniture, bike racks, bollards or putting up barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring any changes to entries, exit and queue management take into account reasonable adjustments for those who need them, including disabled customers. For example, maintaining pedestrian and parking access for disabled customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using outside premises for queuing where available and safe, for example some car parks, if this can be done safely and without removing use of accessible car parking spaces for disabled users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with your local authority or landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, including queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at how people walk through the gym/leisure facility and how you could adjust this to reduce congestion and contact between customers, for example, queue management or one-way flow, where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introducing more one-way flow routes through buildings through signage that clearly indicate the direction of flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organising numbers, routes, schedules for pools, golf courses and ranges, practice nets, climbing walls, similar equipment to maintain distancing.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objective: To ensure distancing among workers/volunteers and customers when using sports and leisure facilities.</p>
</div>

<p>Social distancing should be maintained between all users of facilities including individuals, groups, teams, teachers, trainers and coaches, unless users come from the same household or to manage needs on account of a disability when additional mitigation will be essential.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Suspending or modifying activities that are not permitted or cannot be undertaken without contravening social distancing guidelines within available facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Particular consideration should be taken for indoor courts and sports halls. Courts and halls can remain open for use as long as the activities can be modified in such a way that social distancing can be maintained throughout the activity. This should take into account limitations on participation in organised indoor team sport, and only take place in groups of up to 6 people unless an exemption or easement applies (e.g. organised indoor sport for people with disabilities). Other organised indoor sport, including indoor exercise classes, can continue to take place with larger numbers present, provided that participants are in separate and distinct groups of up to 6 people (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble) which do not mix with other groups. If separate groups are likely to mix, these indoor activities should not go ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual national governing bodies will often provide specific guidance on how their sport can be played or adapted to enable adapted to enable social distancing which must be followed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging, where weather and space permits, use of outdoor spaces for individual, team or group activities (considering where applicable government guidance on social gatherings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having clearly designated positions from which colleagues or coaches/volunteers leading activity can provide advice or assistance to customers whilst maintaining social distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding use of shared objects e.g. towels, robes, balls, weights, rackets, balls, scoring equipment, sports clothing unless they can be cleaned or sanitised between users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that any water fountains have signage which prohibits face-to-tap drinking (no receptacle) and that these facilities are used only to refill personal bottles or containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating beauty, massage and physio services in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/close-contact-services">relevant salon guidance</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Adapting and enabling spaces</strong></p>

<p>Where possible adapt and enable spaces to facilitate appropriate social distancing, including government guided spacing markings on the floor at points of assembly including entrances, foyers and reception spaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fitness spaces</strong>: Pieces of gym equipment to be an appropriate distance apart so as to comply with social distancing guidelines and with a suitable margin for adequate circulation or one-way routes. This can be achieved by moving equipment, using screens to separate equipment, or taking equipment out of use. Clearly visible tape should be put around pieces of gym equipment to denote social distance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Changing rooms</strong>: particular care should be taken to manage congestion and ensure social distancing such as limiting use to alternate lockers, or ideally limiting use to those with special needs and/ or removing use of showers. <br>– Encourage attendees to arrive at the facility in  sports kit and where possible to travel home to change/shower. <br>– Use of changing rooms and showering facilities should in general be avoided where possible, although these must be available for participants with disabilities or special needs and are likely to be needed after swimming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dance and exercise studios</strong>: Where possible, temporary floor marking defining required spacing per individual should be provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pools:</strong> Swimming pools should restrict numbers to allow 3 square metres per bather. If flumes are available, they must be used in a socially distanced manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Saunas and steam rooms</strong> <br>– Maximum capacity should be restricted to 50%. For example, a sauna designed for 4 people should only be used by 2 people at the same time. <br>– Facilities should operate with 2m social distancing, including marked seating points in each room. <br>– Guests should be given fixed times and staggered slots to enter the sauna or steam room. For example, a sauna with a normal capacity for 4 individuals offers an appointment time of 12.00 - 12.15. Up to 2 individuals may book this slot. They must arrive at 12.00. They may leave and re-enter at any time but the sauna must be vacated by everyone at 12.15. <br>– Where technically possible, increase air flow and air changes to the maximum possible. <br>–Ensure that saunas, steam rooms and any equipment are cleaned regularly, at the beginning and end of the day and at regular intervals in-between, determined by the risk assessment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hydrotherapy pools</strong> - capacity should be managed so as to take account of any special needs of the clients. If social distancing cannot be maintained due to immediate safety concerns, close proximity contact should be kept to a minimum by those not part of the same household or social support bubble.</p>

<h3 id="supporting-test-and-trace">2.1.4. Supporting Test and Trace</h3>

<p>Continued opening up of the economy and public services is reliant on NHS Test and Trace being used to minimise transmission of the virus.  In order to ensure that businesses and local services are able to remain open, we will be mandating that organisations in designated sectors must:</p>

<p>●	ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people) to provide their name and contact details</p>

<p>●	keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details</p>

<p>●	keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested</p>

<p>●	display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details</p>

<p>●	adhere to General Data Protection Regulations</p>

<p>This includes clubs providing team sporting activities, indoor sport and leisure centres, outdoor swimming pools and lidos, and sports and massage therapists, and services provided for social and recreational purposes in youth and community centres, and village halls.</p>

<p>Each sport/ NGB will determine in their action plan or guidance the process their sport will go through to enable test and trace efforts to happen by providing the way in which all information on participants will be collected at both training and matches.</p>

<p>In addition, the hospitality sector will be required to ensure that anyone visiting pubs, restaurants and other venues provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS QR code before being allowed entry to the venue.</p>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.</p>

<p>From 28 September, there will be a legal requirement for certain settings to implement COVID-secure guidelines (full list under section 2). This includes ensuring customers adhere to social distancing rules, and taking steps to prevent people meeting in groups larger than 6.</p>

<p>Attendance by spectators and non-participating children should be discouraged and minimised, especially within indoor facilities. Spectators are only permitted in groups of up to 6 (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble), and social distancing must be maintained. Supervised children’s activity is exempt, and this can include adults where they are needed to supervise in a safeguarding role. Parents or other adults who are not acting in a supervisory role are considered to be spectators, and are not exempt.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Steps that will usually be needed:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>If allowing spectators would present challenges to maintaining decided capacity levels, consider prohibiting spectators until further notice.

<p>Objective: To have workers/volunteers and customers maintain government guided social distancing wherever possible, including while arriving at and departing from the gym/leisure facility, while in the gym/leisure facility and when travelling between venues.</p>
</div>

<p>From 28 September, there will be a legal requirement for certain settings to implement COVID-secure guidelines (full list under section 2). This includes ensuring customers adhere to social distancing rules, and taking steps to prevent people meeting in groups larger than 6.</p>

<p>Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full in relation to a particular activity, businesses and/or organisations should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business and/or organisation to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</p>

<p>Mitigating actions include:</p>

<p>▪	Further increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning</p>

<p>▪	Keeping the activity time involved as short as possible</p>

<p>▪	Using screens or barriers to separate people from each other</p>

<p>▪	Using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible</p>

<p>▪	Reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others)</p>

<p>Social distancing applies to all parts of a business and/or organisation, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, canteens and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain social distancing</p>

<h3 id="large-gatherings">Large gatherings</h3>

<p>People should continue to socially distance from those they do not live with wherever possible. Social interactions should be limited to groups of up to 6 people (or larger discrete groups from the same household or support bubble) with social distancing in place at all times.</p>

<p>Those operating venues or running events following COVID-secure guidelines should take additional steps to ensure the safety of the public and prevent large gatherings or mass events from taking place.</p>

<p>Individual businesses or venues should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advising patrons to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities should avoid issuing licenses for events that could lead to larger gatherings forming and provide advice to businesses on how to manage events of this type. If appropriate, the government has powers under schedule 22 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 to close venues hosting large gatherings or prohibit certain events (or types of event) from taking place.</p>

<h2 id="chapter5">5. Ventilation of indoor gym and leisure facilities</h2>

<h3 id="air-extraction-and-ventilation-measures">Air extraction and ventilation measures</h3>

<p>Ventilation is an important part of mitigating against the transmission of COVID-19. Ventilation into the building should be optimised to ensure a fresh air supply is provided to all areas of the facility and increased wherever possible. Particular attention should be given to areas where high intensity exercise activity takes place.</p>

<p>To achieve this, specific measures should be implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum occupancy of each indoor facility  should be limited by providing a minimum of 100sqft per person. For this figure, the area is the net useable indoor facility space available to members to use, including changing rooms, toilet and wash facilities. Reducing capacity in this way whilst sustaining ventilation flows, will increase the typical current 10l/s/p flow rate of ventilation to at least 20l/s/p, as fewer people are being served by the ventilation system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ventilation systems should provide 100% fresh air and not recirculate air from one space to another.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>increasing the existing ventilation rate by fully opening dampers and running fans on full speed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>operating the ventilation system 24 hours a day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increase the frequency of filter changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the absence of known ventilation rates, a carbon dioxide sensor shall be used as a surrogate indicator to switch on additional mechanical ventilation or open windows.</p>
  </li>

<p><strong>In this section</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#section-7-1">7.1 Face coverings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>PPE protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks.</p>

<p>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so.</p>

<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying appropriately distanced away from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.</p>

<p>The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE. For example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups, you should refer to the advice at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe-plan">COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly.</p>

<h3 id="section-7-1">7.1. Face coverings</h3>

<p>From 23 September, we have expanded the settings in which face coverings are required. This does not include gyms, leisure centres and other sport facilities, however when not engaging in sport and physical activity visitors should be encouraged to wear masks in enclosed public areas where possible and practical. Staff in close contact services are required to wear a mask and a visor when providing services.</p>

<p>From 28 September, all businesses are required to remind customers to wear face masks where mandated.</p>

<p><strong>In this section</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#section-10-1">10.1 Workforce planning to provide a safe environment </a></li>
  <li><a href="#section-10-2">10.2 Session organisation and activity grouping </a></li>
  <li><a href="#section-10-3">10.3 Training for returning to activity</a></li>
  <li><a href="#section-10-4">10.4 Wellbeing and inclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers have a vital role to play in helping to ensure the safe return to activity for many sports.  This is particularly true of community sports clubs and groups, who are often entirely dependent on volunteers giving their time to enable the club to deliver sport and operate safely.</p>

<p>Whilst there are many consistencies between the paid workforce and volunteers in relation to safety and welfare, the principal difference is choice.  Unlike paid workers, volunteers have no obligation to return, whereas staff are likely to have an employment contract and other employment legislation to protect both them and their employers.</p>

<p>Ensuring volunteers are ready to re-engage and feel able to give their time in a safe environment will be critical to the resumption of activity within clubs. It is important that appropriate consideration is given to identify the practical steps that can be taken to ensure they feel supported, welcomed and most importantly ensure they can volunteer safely.</p>

<p>We know that the types of clubs, groups and community organisations that support sport and physical activity are diverse and so one size will not fit all when it comes to supporting volunteers. This guidance therefore aims to provide some headline considerations for organisations and groups to think about in their planning at this time. It does not cover everything that needs to be considered or every context where volunteers will be involved but instead is designed to work alongside more detailed guidance which is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.sportengland.org/how-we-can-help/coronavirus">Sport England website</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Consulting <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/practical-support/information/coronavirus">NVCO advice on volunteering</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consulting your national governing body for sport-specific guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting a phased approach to bring people back to the club and organisation and expanding the activity offer over a period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with stakeholders to clarify the organisational and operational requirements the organisation needs to put in place before returning to activity and designating a point person who will be responsible for making sure these requirements are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting measures in place to ensure that the facility, location or context where volunteering is taking place is safe, including by conducting your own risk assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where running activities for children without their parent or carer’s supervision, consulting the Department for Education guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak">protective measures for out-of-school settings</a> which sets out further practical steps providers of community activities, holiday clubs, after-school clubs, tuition and other out-of-school provision for children should follow to minimise the risk of transmission for children attending their settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the tasks and roles needed to support activities that can take place. For example, how many volunteers you need, in what roles and how those roles may need to be adapted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following public health guidelines to assess individual circumstances and levels of risk, to support decisions about whether it is safe for individuals to volunteer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering that volunteers may have other responsibilities at this time such as looking after relatives, childcare or changing working circumstances. Identify what time they may be able to commit and what flexibility and support they may need to undertake their volunteering role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing a plan for ongoing communication with members, volunteers, parents and carers which includes consulting on their intentions to return and regularly updating on re-opening plans including providing members with advanced access to guidance.</p>
