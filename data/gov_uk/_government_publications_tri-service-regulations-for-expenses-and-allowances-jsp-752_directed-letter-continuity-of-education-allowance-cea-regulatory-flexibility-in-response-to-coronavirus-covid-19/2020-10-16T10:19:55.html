<p>I am directed to inform and update you on the increased flexibility introduced to the arrangements for Continuity of Education Allowance (<abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr>) in response to Coronavirus (COVID19) and associated border control restrictions. This directed letter replaces the previous directed letters issued on 21 May<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">1</a></sup> and 17 July<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">2</a></sup> and also incorporates the advice provided by D AFPPol on 7 April<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances).</strong></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Under current circumstances it is necessary to introduce further flexibility into current <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> policy. This will reassure <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants that any deviation from <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility criteria caused, (or contributed to), directly by COVID-19, will not adversely affect their <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility. Circumstances that may require a deviation from current <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> policy are detailed at Annex A of this directed letter. Any other circumstances not covered by this directed letter should be declared to the PACCC, where consideration will be given to the ongoing circumstances brought about by COVID-19.</p>

<p><abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should continue to claim <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> and pay the school fees for each academic term as presented to them. If they subsequently become liable for any additional school fees, as a result of the COVID-19 related scenarios at Annex A, they will be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of this directed letter. Any claims for additional school fees for boarding and tuition relating to these scenarios will be considered separately from the main termly <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claims; the arrangements for reimbursement of additional costs are also detailed at Annex A.</p>

<p><strong>Similarly, any reimbursements from the school to the claimant that arise because of COVID-19 must be declared to the department and (where necessary) repaid within 30 days of receipt.</strong> The arrangements for the repayment of reimbursed fees are detailed at Annex B.</p>

<h2 id="accompanied-status">Accompanied status</h2>

<p>Accompanied Status is an underpinning principle of qualification for <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr>. The guidance on Accompanied Status<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">4</a></sup>, requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (RWA) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their ongoing eligibility for <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (CO)<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If the circumstances relating to COVID-19 cause or contribute to the spouse/civil partner being absent from the RWA for in excess of 90 days<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">6</a></sup>, <strong>the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant should remain assured that the CO will acknowledge this during their assessment of their accompanied status<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">7</a></sup></strong>.</p>

<p>Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any COVID-19 related travel restrictions are reversed<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">8</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>It is important to note that parents, or appointed guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area for those assigned overseas. SP should make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a>, Defence <a rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/HOCS/Pages/Defence-policy-statements.aspx" class="govuk-link">Defence Advice Notes</a> as well as any guidance and arrangements published by host nations. Parents should also ensure that they inform their CofC of any changes to their personal circumstances.</p>

<p>UK Self-isolation requirements are set out in the government guidance, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">UK Border Control</a>.</p>

<p>The terms of this directed letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances). Any additional costs to <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> as a result of COVID-19 are to be retained so the information is available for auditing purposes.</p>

<h4 id="covid-19-related-deviations-from-cea-policy-and-claiming-additional-costs">COVID-19 related deviations from <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> policy and claiming additional costs</h4>

<p>The circumstances that may require a deviation from current <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> policy include (but are not be limited to):</p>

<p>a. <strong>The child is prevented from travelling to join their parents by governmental travel directive and/or the imposition of a mandatory period of quarantine or isolation and they are unable to join a designated guardian for valid reasons (e.g. the guardian is self-isolating) and continue to be accommodated at their school.</strong> In this case, where the child remains at the school, (outside of the normal academic term times), the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees without paying any parental contribution. This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p>

<p>b. <strong>Where the school has decided it is unsafe for a child to remain in the boarding environment at the school, but it is practicable for the child to convert to day-pupil status for the period covered by these arrangements.</strong> In this case, if the child can live with their parents or a designated guardian and travel to the school daily, the claimant may convert to claiming <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> (Day) from the beginning of the next academic term<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link">9</a></sup>. This will apply even if their child has not completed three consecutive academic terms at the same school as a full boarder. Should the school subsequently be required to close altogether, the child should stay with their parents or a designated guardian. In these circumstances <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will not be adversely affected.</p>

<p>c. <strong>The child travels to an overseas area but is prevented from returning to their school because of a government travel restriction, school closure or the imposition of a mandatory period of quarantine or isolation.</strong> Where a child is required to remain at the overseas duty station, the parent will continue to receive the appropriate accompanied rate of Local Overseas Allowance until the child is able to return to their school. <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will be unaffected.</p>

<p>d. <strong>Where a claimant is about to complete their service and a delay in examinations causes an extension to an Academic year.</strong> In these circumstances the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees, (less the parental contribution). This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding and tuition elements of the school fees. This must be authorised by the CO and supported by advice from the Children’s Education Advisory Service (CEAS) with the CO notifying the PACCC in the process. This provision will last for as many academic terms as necessary to complete the academic year.</p>

<p>e. <strong>Where COVID-19 impacts on critical stages of education (GCSEs, A-Levels, B-TECs and Scottish Nationals and Highers or equivalents) and the school recommends an extra academic year.</strong> Where the school has recommended an additional academic year, the claimant should make a written application to the CEAS (including the advice of the school). The CEAS will make its own recommendation and forward to the PACCC for a decision<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="govuk-link">10</a></sup>. Reimbursement of any additional school fees will be limited to those in respect of the subjects for which the child was studying before the COVID-19 crisis began and will be subject to the usual parental contribution.</p>

<p>f. <strong>For claimants of Guardians Allowance (GA) where the child must remain with the guardian after the end of the academic year.</strong> In these circumstances GA will remain in issue until the child is reunited with their parents or the travel restrictions are reversed; whichever is sooner.</p>

<p>g. <strong>Where the school has reduced its fees to below the appropriate <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> maximum, will Admissible Extras<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="govuk-link">11</a></sup> be payable?</strong> Where the revised net fee (less the appropriate parental contribution) is less than the appropriate maximum rate of <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr>, then compulsory costs directly leading to public examinations<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="govuk-link">12</a></sup> will be considered admissible. Examples of such costs are, examination entrance fees (but not re-sits) or the cost of essential or compulsory textbooks. Where there is any doubt Unit HR should review the advice on repayments at Annex B. Where doubt remains, they are to seek advice from the PACCC who should consult the CEAS if necessary. Any costs considered admissible are subject to the usual parental contribution.</p>

<p>h. <strong>Where <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are preparing to submit a <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificate for their child’s 6th Form stage of education.</strong> Under <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> regulations, claimants are advised to submit their <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificates (<abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> ECs) during a window between 15 months and 6 months before the academic term in which their child is expected to enter the 6th form or “A” Level (or equivalent) stage of education<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="govuk-link">13</a></sup>. For those <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants with a child due to start 6th form in September 21, the window has been open since June 20. <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should note, that due to potential future restrictions on the PACCCs ability to process <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> ECs due to COVID-19. The response times for 6th Form applications for those applying may be longer than usual and may go beyond the 20-working day target for a response.</p>

<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>

<p>For the purposes of submitting routine <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claims and claiming back additional costs, the following applies:</p>

<p><abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are to continue to claim for their main termly <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claims in accordance with routine procedures.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants incur additional costs as detailed in this Annex, they are to be claimed using a manual <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claim form<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="govuk-link">14</a></sup> clearly identified as COVID-19 Additional Costs. Defence Business Services (<abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr>) will process claims allowing SP to be reimbursed above normal <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> ceilings.</p>

<p><abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs.</p>

<p>Standard <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> response times may need to be extended to facilitate the processing of manual claims in the COVID-19 environment.</p>

<h4 id="arrangement-for-the-repayment-of-reimbursed-cea">Arrangement for the repayment of reimbursed <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr>
</h4>

<p>When <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are advised of a reduction or refund in fees by their child’s school, they should immediately inform their Unit HR providing details of the original school bill and the reduced fees.</p>

<p>The instructions detailed in this Annex were first introduced for Summer Term 20. However, depending on future restrictions that may be caused by COVID-19 and for how long those restrictions endure, these instructions should be considered -where necessary-to apply also to subsequent academic terms.</p>

<p>Claimants must bear in mind that <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> is publicly funded money and as such, refunds offered in any form in relation to school fees must be accepted and declared to their Unit HR. There are various scenarios in which a reduction in fees may occur:</p>

<p>a. <strong>The claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term and has subsequently received a revised bill indicating a refund.</strong> In these circumstances the claimant should declare the refund to their Unit HR and provide a copy of the original and reduced bills. Unit HR will then conduct an assessment and inform the claimant of the necessary repayment, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant must then repay the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="MInistry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex.</p>

<p>b. <strong>The claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term but had not submitted a claim for <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> when they received a subsequent revised bill indicating a refund.</strong> In these circumstances, the claimant should declare the refund to their Unit HR providing a copy of the original and reduced bills. They should then submit their <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claim but for the reduced amount.</p>

<p>c. <strong>The <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term, has not received a revised bill but has received a payment direct from the school.</strong> In these circumstances, the claimant should declare the payment to their Unit HR. They should provide copies of the original school bill and any documentation showing the payment made to them by the school. The Unit HR will then conduct an assessment and confirm the value of the necessary <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> repayment with the claimant, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant must then repay the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="MInistry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex.</p>

<p>d. <strong>The <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term, the school has offered no reimbursement for the academic term but has offered to reduce their fees for the next academic term.</strong> In these circumstances, if the claimant does not get a retrospective amendment to the bill for the current term, they should declare the intended fee reduction for the subsequent term to their Unit HR. They should then claim the reduced fees for that term in accordance with the routine process.</p>

<p>e. <strong>Where the school has closed or entered administration.</strong> In these circumstances, the claimant should pay any outstanding bills to the school. They should then declare any unused <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> to their Unit HR providing a copy of the original and reduced bills. If necessary, Unit HR will then conduct an assessment and inform the claimant of the necessary repayment, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant should then repay the unused <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="MInistry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex. Any refund received by the claimant in respect of subsequent academic terms should be similarly declared.</p>

<p>Any other circumstances not covered by this DL should be considered on a case by case basis and submitted to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below).</p>

<p>Examples of how Unit HR should assess any necessary repayments with guidance notes are detailed at <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926832/appendix_1_annex_B_20201012-DL_Update-COVID-19-Continuity_of_Education_Allowance_Arrangements-_1_.pdf" class="govuk-link">Appendix 1 to this Annex</a>.</p>

<p>Where it is necessary for the <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant to repay <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> already received in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 3.a, 3.c or 3.e above, separate payments should be made where they are claiming for more than one child. Payments must be made within 30 days of receipt as follows:</p>

<p>Each repayment must be clearly marked with a reference consisting of the individuals Service Number, the academic term to which it refers, the child’s name and “COVID-19 <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> Repayment; e.g., 123456X Academic Term Smith, John COVID-19 <abbr title="continunity education allowance">CEA</abbr> Repayment<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="govuk-link">15</a></sup> .</p>

This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p><p>b. <strong>Where the school has decided it is unsafe for a child to remain in the boarding environment at the school, but it is practicable for the child to convert to day-pupil status for the period covered by these arrangements.</strong> In this case, if the child can live with their parents or a designated guardian and travel to the school daily, the claimant may convert to claiming <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> (Day) from the beginning of the next academic term<sup id=\"fnref:9\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"govuk-link\">9</a></sup>. This will apply even if their child has not completed three consecutive academic terms at the same school as a full boarder. Should the school subsequently be required to close altogether, the child should stay with their parents or a designated guardian. In these circumstances <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> eligibility will not be adversely affected.</p><p>c. <strong>The child travels to an overseas area but is prevented from returning to their school because of a government travel restriction, school closure or the imposition of a mandatory period of quarantine or isolation.</strong> Where a child is required to remain at the overseas duty station, the parent will continue to receive the appropriate accompanied rate of Local Overseas Allowance until the child is able to return to their school. <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> eligibility will be unaffected.</p><p>d. <strong>Where a claimant is about to complete their service and a delay in examinations causes an extension to an Academic year.</strong> In these circumstances the <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> claimant will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees, (less the parental contribution). This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding and tuition elements of the school fees. This must be authorised by the CO and supported by advice from the Children’s Education Advisory Service (CEAS) with the CO notifying the PACCC in the process. This provision will last for as many academic terms as necessary to complete the academic year.</p><p>e. <strong>Where COVID-19 impacts on critical stages of education (GCSEs, A-Levels, B-TECs and Scottish Nationals and Highers or equivalents) and the school recommends an extra academic year.</strong> Where the school has recommended an additional academic year, the claimant should make a written application to the CEAS (including the advice of the school). The CEAS will make its own recommendation and forward to the PACCC for a decision<sup id=\"fnref:10\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"govuk-link\">10</a></sup>. Reimbursement of any additional school fees will be limited to those in respect of the subjects for which the child was studying before the COVID-19 crisis began and will be subject to the usual parental contribution.</p><p>f. <strong>For claimants of Guardians Allowance (GA) where the child must remain with the guardian after the end of the academic year.</strong> In these circumstances GA will remain in issue until the child is reunited with their parents or the travel restrictions are reversed; whichever is sooner.</p><p>g. <strong>Where the school has reduced its fees to below the appropriate <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> maximum, will Admissible Extras<sup id=\"fnref:11\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"govuk-link\">11</a></sup> be payable?</strong> Where the revised net fee (less the appropriate parental contribution) is less than the appropriate maximum rate of <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr>, then compulsory costs directly leading to public examinations<sup id=\"fnref:12\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"govuk-link\">12</a></sup> will be considered admissible. Examples of such costs are, examination entrance fees (but not re-sits) or the cost of essential or compulsory textbooks. Where there is any doubt Unit HR should review the advice on repayments at Annex B. Where doubt remains, they are to seek advice from the PACCC who should consult the CEAS if necessary. Any costs considered admissible are subject to the usual parental contribution.</p><p>h. <strong>Where <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> claimants are preparing to submit a <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificate for their child’s 6th Form stage of education.</strong> Under <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> regulations, claimants are advised to submit their <abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificates (<abbr title=\"continunity education allowance\">CEA</abbr> ECs) during a window between 15 months and 6 months before the academic term in which their child is expected to enter the 6th form or “A” Level (or equivalent) stage of education<sup id=\"fnref:13\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"govuk-link\">13</a></sup>.
