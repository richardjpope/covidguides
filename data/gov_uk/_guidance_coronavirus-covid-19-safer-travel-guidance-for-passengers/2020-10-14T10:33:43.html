<h2 id="travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>You can help control coronavirus and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. Where this is not possible, use public transport or drive. You can also help control coronavirus by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working from home where possible</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions" class="govuk-link">checking your local COVID alert level</a> before travel</li>
  <li>observing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social contact rules</a> as applicable to your local COVID alert level</li>
  <li>keeping your distance when you travel, where possible</li>
  <li>washing or sanitising your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>downloading the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and checking in where you see official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not travel at all if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are experiencing any <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">self-isolating as a result of coronavirus symptoms or sharing a household or support bubble with somebody with symptoms</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, however mild, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#while-you-are-self-isolating-make-sure-you-do-the-following-things" class="govuk-link">self-isolate for at least 10 days</a> from when your symptoms started. If you are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for coronavirus you should self-isolate for at least 10 days starting from the day the test was taken.</p>

<p>If you have tested positive whilst not experiencing symptoms but develop symptoms during the isolation period, you should restart the 10 day isolation period from the day you develop symptoms.</p>

<p>If anyone in your household or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> has symptoms of coronavirus you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#while-you-are-self-isolating-make-sure-you-do-the-following-things" class="govuk-link">stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days</a>.</p>

<h2 id="local-covid-alert-levels">Local COVID alert levels</h2>

<p>There is now a system of local COVID alert levels in England. If you live, work, volunteer or travel to from or within an area that is part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-medium" class="govuk-link">medium (tier 1)</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-high" class="govuk-link">high (tier 2)</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-very-high" class="govuk-link">very high (tier 3)</a> local COVID alert level, there are additional restrictions which apply to you.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions" class="govuk-link">Check your local COVID alert level</a> before you travel.</p>
</div>

<p>The rules for local COVID alert levels are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-and-localised-restrictions" class="govuk-link">local COVID alert levels in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-phase-3-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/" class="govuk-link">local COVID alert levels in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/local-lockdown" class="govuk-link">local COVID alert levels in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="social-distancing">Social distancing</h2>

<p>You should maintain a 2 metre distance where possible, because the risk of transmission is small at this distance.</p>

<p>If you cannot keep a 2 metre distance, reduce the risk to yourself and others by maintaining a 1 metre distance where possible, and taking suitable precautions.</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe, by taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limit the number of people or households that you come into contact with, for example by avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>travel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>touch as few surfaces as possible</li>
  <li>stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>minimise the time spent close to other people, where possible</li>
  <li>avoid loud talking, shouting or singing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England unless you are exempt.</p>

<h2 id="social-contact">Social contact</h2>

<p>You must observe the relevant social contact rules that apply to you when you travel. The rules vary according to the local COVID alert level in place across England and are different for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-medium" class="govuk-link">medium (tier 1)</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-high" class="govuk-link">high (tier 2)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-very-high" class="govuk-link">very high (tier 3)</a> alert levels.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions" class="govuk-link">Check your local COVID alert level</a> before you travel.</p>
</div>

<p>The relevant social contact rules set out in the different local COVID alert levels apply to you when you are travelling to an area with a higher alert level from the one where you are normally resident once you cross into that area. The rules in place where you are normally resident also apply to you for the duration of your journey if you are travelling to an area with a lower COVID alert level in place. They apply to you whether you are using public or private transport.</p>

<p>When travelling on public transport, aircraft, taxis, private hire vehicles, coaches, ferries or other maritime vessels you must not gather with others outside of your group that is permitted under the relevant social contact rules. Also try to keep within your group and distance yourself from others where possible.</p>

<p>Under all the relevant social contact rules, whatever the alert level, there are some activities for which individuals are still permitted to travel in groups which do not otherwise conform to the requirements of the relevant social contact rules, but only where this travel is reasonably necessary in order to carry out a specific activity, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with work, or as part of voluntary or charitable services, for example, transport organised by an employer during the course of your work</li>
  <li>with registered childcare, education or training, for example, transport organised by schools</li>
  <li>as part of supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care, youth groups and activities, and childrenâ€™s playgroups, but only where those activities are provided by a registered professional</li>
  <li>providing support to a vulnerable person</li>
  <li>providing emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm</li>
  <li>making arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians</li>
  <li>training or competition, where the person concerned is an elite sportsperson</li>
  <li>where fulfilling a legal obligation such as attending court or jury service</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you are recommended to check the relevant social contact rules in force to check if a particular activity applies to your journey</p>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those that break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£200 for those who participate in illegal gatherings.</p>

<p>People aged 18 or over can be fined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£200 for the first offence, lowered to Â£100 if paid within 14 days</li>
  <li>Â£400 for the second offence, then doubling for each further offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules for social contact are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">social contact in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-phase-3-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/" class="govuk-link">social contact in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-leaving-your-home-and-seeing-other-people-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">social contact in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="face-coverings">Face coverings</h2>

<p>A face covering is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth. Surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should continue to be reserved for people who need to wear them at work.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for maintaining <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a> and good hand hygiene.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">How to wear and make a face covering</a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-you-must-wear-face-coverings">Where you must wear face coverings</h3>

<p>It is the law that you <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/592/contents" class="govuk-link">must wear a face covering when travelling in England</a> on public transport. Such as, on or in a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bus or coach</li>
  <li>train or tram</li>
  <li>ferry or hovercraft or other vessel</li>
  <li>taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>aircraft</li>
  <li>cable car</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs from which passenger services operate. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>airports</li>
  <li>rail stations and terminals</li>
  <li>the Channel Tunnel terminal in Kent</li>
  <li>ports and terminals</li>
  <li>bus, coach and tram stations and terminals</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in other indoor settings.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you will be breaking the law and could be fined. The fine for a first offence is Â£200, or Â£100 if you pay the fine within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of Â£6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to Â£400 and a third fine will be Â£800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be Â£6,400.</p>

<p>These laws apply while you are in England. If travelling from any other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nation, you will be required to wear a face covering when you enter England, regardless of the rules in the nation you are transiting from.</p>

<h3 id="other-areas-you-should-wear-a-face-covering">Other areas you should wear a face covering</h3>

<p>You must also wear a face covering by law in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">some other public places</a>, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age or health, or if you have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">a legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to also wear a face covering in other enclosed spaces where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, or where there are people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>The rule applies in situations where individuals from different households or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubbles</a> could be travelling together on a service such as a charter boat, but not if you are giving a lift to someone from another household or support bubble in your private car.</p>

<p>The rules for wearing face coverings are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<h3 id="face-covering-exemptions">Face covering exemptions</h3>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">donâ€™t have to wear a face covering</a> including for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>Government and some operators have produced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#documents" class="govuk-link">cards and badges</a> which you can choose to wear to show you are exempt. There is no requirement to do this though, and if you rely on an exemption, transport staff should not ordinarily ask for evidence.</p>

<p>Some transport staff may also not wear a face covering if it is not required for their job.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-can-remove-your-face-covering">When you can remove your face covering</h3>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a <a href="#legitimate-reasons-not-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>You are also able to remove your face covering when seated to eat or drink in a hospitality premise. This includes pubs, bars, restaurants or cafÃ©s located inside transport hubs. You must put your face covering back on once you finish eating or drinking. Where possible, check in using the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance. Alternatively, you can provide your contact details.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering. For longer journeys, take more than one face covering and a plastic bag for used face coverings.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-used-face-coverings">Disposing of used face coverings</h3>

<p>Use a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">dispose</a> of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<h2 id="walking-and-cycling">Walking and cycling</h2>

<p>Walk orâ€¯<a rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/cycle-safety" class="govuk-link">cycle</a>â€¯if you can.</p>

<p>This will reduce pressure on public transport and the road network.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local council</a> can help you plan your journey by providing maps showing dedicated paths and routes.</p>

<p>You must observe <a href="#social-contact" class="govuk-link">social contact rules</a> while walking or cycling in England.</p>

<p>Where possible,â€¯<a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">keep a suitable distance from other people</a>. For example, when waiting at crossings and traffic lights. Take precautions where this is not possible.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands before and after cycling.</p>

<p>People from a household or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> can travel together in a vehicle.</p>

<p>You should wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isnâ€™t possible and where you will come into contact with people outside your household or support bubble. Take care to <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">use face coverings properly</a>.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a href="#checklists-for-safer-travel" class="govuk-link">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h3 id="car-sharing">Car sharing</h3>

<p>It is difficult to socially distance during car journeys. You should avoid sharing a car with someone from outside your household or your support bubble unless you can practise social distancing. You can reduce the risk of transmission by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening windows for ventilation</li>
  <li>travelling side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>facing away from each other</li>
  <li>considering seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicle</li>
  <li>cleaning your car between journeys using standard cleaning products - make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touch</li>
  <li>asking the driver and passengers to <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">wear a face covering</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="on-your-journey">On your journey</h3>

<p>Expect more pedestrians and cyclists, especially at peak times of day. Where possible, allow other road users to <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">maintain social distancing</a>. For example, give cyclists space at traffic lights.</p>

<p>At garages, petrol stations and motorway services try to keep your distance from other people and if possible pay by contactless.

The rules in place where you are normally resident also apply to you for the duration of your journey if you are travelling to an area with a lower COVID alert level in place. They apply to you whether you are using public or private transport.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling on public transport, aircraft, taxis, private hire vehicles, coaches, ferries or other maritime vessels you must not gather with others outside of your group that is permitted under the relevant social contact rules.
