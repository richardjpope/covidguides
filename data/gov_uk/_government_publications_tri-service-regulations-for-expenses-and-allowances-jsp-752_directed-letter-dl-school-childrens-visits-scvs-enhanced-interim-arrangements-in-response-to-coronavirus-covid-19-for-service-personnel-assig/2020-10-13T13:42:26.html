<h2 id="from-defence-people-af-rem-allces-2-october-2020">From: Defence People AF Rem Allces 2 October 2020</h2>

<p>1.
I am directed to inform you of the following enhanced interim arrangements for School Children’s Visits (SCVs) in response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) and border control restrictions. This replaces the <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> DLs issued on 9 and 16 March 2020 and the DL issued on border restrictions dated 4 June 2020 which are now rescinded. These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Rem Allowances. UK self-isolation requirements are set out in the Government guidance available on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ukborder-control" class="govuk-link">gov.uk Border Control page</a>.</p>

<p>2.
<abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> policy has been reviewed to provide further flexibility to allow parents to manage SCVs under challenging conditions. Policy changes now allow for reverse SCVs for both parents to return to the UK for the Christmas 2020 end of term holiday period where COVID-19 restrictions in the UK and/or the overseas assignment area, or lack of UNMIN service, mean travel overseas for the child is impracticable. Subsistence for any mandatory self-isolation period is also now permitted subject to the caveats described in the scenarios at the Annex to this DL. This applies to the October 2020 and February 2021 half term and Christmas 2020 end of term school holidays as well as to any mandatory self-isolation associated with school closures during term time. Where a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> would normally be from UK to the overseas assignment area, but one or both parents are now temporarily living in the UK due to evacuation or unable to return due to COVID-19 restrictions a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> within the UK can now be permitted in lieu of the normal overseas <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.
The provisions are listed at the Annex to this DL and should be read alongside JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits. It is emphasised that SP should submit any flight booking requests as soon as possible. Flights, where they are operating, may be limited and subject to the risk of cancellation.</p>

<p>4.
It is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times, including whilst on SCVs. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area and make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href="www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a> as well as any host nation guidance and arrangements.</p>

<p>5.
The guidance on Accompanied Status (JSP 752, Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 2) requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (RWA) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their accompanied status will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (CO). If the exceptional circumstances relating to COVID-19 cause (or contribute to) the spouse/civil partner being absent from the RWA in excess of 90 days, the CO should acknowledge this during their assessment of the claimant’s accompanied status. Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any COVID-19 related travel restrictions are reversed1.</p>

<p>6.
The arrangements in this DL do not extend to children over the age of 18 attending a nationally accredited establishment and entitled to SCVs under the terms of JSP 752 10.0210 b. Reverse visits are not normally permitted for children in this category. However, for the end of term Christmas 2020 holiday period only, a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> for one parent will be permitted. In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<p>7.
For children over the age of 18 with Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND), or with complex needs requiring specialist support (see JSP 752 10.0210 c. and d.) the provisions of this DL will apply.</p>

<p>8.
The terms of this DL will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by AF Rem Allowances. The additional costs associated with the arrangements covered in this DL should be recorded so that they are available should this information be required at a later date.

<h2 id="annex-to-directed-letter-school-childrens-visits-dated-2-october-2020">Annex to Directed Letter, School Children’s Visits, dated 2 October 2020</h2>

<p>The following provisions should be read alongside JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits.</p>

<h3 id="a-what-if-flights-are-not-available-tofrom-my-overseas-assignment-area-due-to-covid-19-restrictions-but-it-is-possible-to-make-a-scv-journey-by-vehicle-and-i-wish-to-do-so">a. What if flights are not available to/from my overseas assignment area due to COVID-19 restrictions but it is possible to make a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> journey by vehicle and I wish to do so?</h3>

<p>In this scenario, you may choose to travel by car and claim the cost of ferry/Eurotunnel and terminal Motor Mileage Allowance (MMA) travel in line with the regulations already in place for those assigned to North West Europe (JSP 752 Para 10.0211c refers). In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) Subsistence Allowance is not authorised.</p>

<h3 id="b-what-if-due-to-mandatory-self-isolation-provisions-in-either-the-uk-or-an-overseas-assignment-area-or-due-to-a-lack-of-an-unaccompanied-minors-unmin-service-it-is-not-practicable-for-a-child-to-travel-to-the-overseas-area-on-a-scv-at-the-christmas-2020-end-of-term-school-holiday-period-and-the-sp-wishes-to-arrange-a-reverse-scv-instead">b. What if, due to mandatory self-isolation provisions in either the UK or an overseas assignment area or due to a lack of an Unaccompanied Minors (UNMIN) service, it is not practicable for a child to travel to the overseas area on a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> at the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period and the SP wishes to arrange a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> instead?</h3>

<p><abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. Should a parent consider this to be the preferred option for them during the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period, then a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> may be authorised for both parents and any accompanying members of the immediate family1 in lieu of one <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> for each eligible child. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons, which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year.</p>

<h3 id="c-if-i-have-to-arrange-a-reverse-scv-over-the-christmas-2020-end-of-term-school-holiday-period-for-both-parents-and-any-accompanying-members-of-the-immediate-family1-or-a-reverse-scv-for-one-parent-at-october-2020-or-february-2021-half-term-or-during-the-school-year-due-to-school-closure-can-i-claim-any-subsistence-costs">c. If I have to arrange a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> over the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period (for both parents and any accompanying members of the immediate family1) or a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> (for one parent) at October 2020 or February 2021 half term or during the school year due to school closure, can I claim any subsistence costs?</h3>

<p>Reverse SCVs do not normally attract payment of subsistence. However, where a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> is necessary, and there is a mandatory self-isolation period applied by the UK Government on travellers from the country the SP is assigned to, subsistence allowance may be claimed for the duration of the self-isolation period only as detailed below. Where this is applicable it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible; however it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family.</p>

<p>The Government or devolved administrations’ COVID 19 restrictions may also limit options for some families (e.g. rule of 6 etc). SP should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options for mandatory self-isolation have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order, starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1).</p>

<h4 id="parents-and-children-to-use-the-service-cotswold-centre-or-welfare-housing">1. Parent(s) and child(ren) to use the Service Cotswold Centre or welfare housing.</h4>

<p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There would not be a second accommodation charge incurred to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation; from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<h4 id="parents-and-children-stay-with-friends-or-family">2. Parent(s) and child(ren) stay with friends or family.</h4>

<p>Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (PAR) may be claimed for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Only one PAR claim is permissible per night, per family and neither Day nor Night subsistence claims are admissible. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent(s) to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member; to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent(s) or the guardian including the return journey); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h3 id="if-neither-of-the-above-options-are-available-or-the-familys-specific-welfare-needs-as-determined-by-service-welfare-authorities-dictate-then-the-parents-and-children-may-stay-in-a-hotel-for-the-duration-of-the-mandatory-self-isolation-period">
<span class="number">3. </span> If neither of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent(s) and child(ren) may stay in a hotel for the duration of the mandatory self-isolation period.</h3>

<p>The hotel must be booked by Unit Admin through HRG for full board (Lunch, Dinner, Bed and Breakfast). If full board is not available then actual costs up to the normal UK daily subsistence rate can be claimed for each day, for the parents and each child, for the mandatory self-isolation period only. JSP 752, Chapter 5, Para 05.0108 refers. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school; and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h3 id="d-what-if-airlines-are-not-currently-offering-an-unmin-service-and-i-wish-to-travel-with-the-children-tofrom-the-overseas-assignment-country">d. What if airlines are not currently offering an UNMIN service and I wish to travel with the child(ren) to/from the overseas assignment country?</h3>

<p>Where a parent must accompany their child(ren) and comply with any mandatory self-isolation requirements on arrival in the UK, JSP 752 published policy applies. However, this will now be extended to cover dependant children2 who would normally travel unaccompanied, but may now require a parent to accompany them if they are required to self-isolate in a hotel in the UK prior to commencement of the school term.</p>

<p>This includes those attending University if exceptional individual circumstances mean this is essential and is agreed by Chain of Command. The following options for subsistence should be considered, and it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However, it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family.</p>

<p>The Government or devolved administrations’ COVID 19 restrictions may also limit options for some families (e.g. rule of 6 etc). SP should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1). As stated above, Service personnel should discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action.</p>

<h4 id="self-isolation-period-completed-at-boarding-school-for-the-children-and-the-parent-returns-overseas-immediately">1. Self-isolation period completed at boarding school for the child(ren) and the parent returns overseas immediately.</h4>

<p>Any additional costs incurred for the boarding element of school fees for a mandatory self-isolation period prior to the start of term, which are proportionate to regular boarding fees and charged to all parents for self-isolation, will be refunded in full.</p>

<p>For claimants of Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA), additional costs are to be claimed using a manual CEA claim form clearly identified as COVID-19 Additional Costs. Defence Business Services (DBS) will process claims allowing SP to be reimbursed above normal CEA ceilings. CEA claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are not permitted unless they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4 id="self-isolation-carried-out-at-the-home-of-a-nominated-guardian">2. Self-isolation carried out at the home of a nominated Guardian.</h4>

<p>Where possible we would expect it to be just the child(ren) who self-isolates at the home of the nominated Guardian and the parent would be able to return overseas immediately. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians)3 is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the COVID-19 restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is self-isolating with the Guardian and the parent is not present. Where it is necessary for the parent to remain with the child(ren) at the home of the Guardian for all or part of the mandatory self-isolation period, then PAR may be claimed.</p>

<p>Only one PAR claim is permissible per night per family and Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) is not payable on nights when PAR is claimed. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted for: the parent to transport the child to the home of the guardian, to take the child to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4 id="parent-and-children-self-isolate-in-service-welfare-housing">3. Parent and child(ren) self-isolate in Service welfare housing.</h4>

<p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There will not be a second accommodation charge made to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation, from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off) and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<h4 id="parent-and-children-self-isolate-with-friends-or-family">4. Parent and child(ren) self-isolate with friends or family.</h4>

<p>Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (PAR) may be claimed for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Only one PAR claim is permissible per night per family. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member, to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4 id="if-none-of-the-above-options-are-available-or-the-familys-specific-welfare-needs-as-determined-by-service-welfare-authorities-dictate-then-the-parent-and-children-may-stay-in-a-hotel-for-the-duration-of-the-mandatory-self-isolation-period">5. If none of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent and child(ren) may stay in a hotel for the duration of the mandatory self-isolation period.</h4>

<p>The hotel must be booked by Unit Admin through HRG for full board (Lunch, Dinner, Bed and Breakfast). If full board is not available then subsistence at the normal UK daily subsistence rate can be claimed for each day for the parent and each child. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

What if a Service person (SP) decides that their child should not travel to the overseas area on a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> (through personal choice rather than because of COVID-19 restrictions) and wishes to arrange a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> instead?</h3>

<p>The regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<h3 id="f-what-if-a-service-person-sp-andor-their-spouse-has-been-evacuated-to-uk-from-the-overseas-assignment-area-or-is-unable-to-return-to-the-overseas-assignment-area-due-to-covid-19">f. What if a Service person (SP) and/or their spouse has been evacuated to UK from the overseas assignment area, or is unable to return to the overseas assignment area due to COVID-19?</h3>

<p>Can a <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> within the UK be permitted in lieu of the <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> to the overseas area? Yes, the regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0211) should be followed to arrange travel within the UK to/from the child(ren)s school to the accommodation that the parent(s) will be occupying in the UK during the <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr>. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to change travel plans because of official advice from the <a href="www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a>, advice from the child(ren)’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled. The costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the MOD. The <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> can then be re-arranged for a later date or a reverse <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> can be authorised instead.</p>

<p>In this scenario, where the decision was based on preference rather than any official advice, parents could decide to cancel the <abbr title="school children’s visit">SCV</abbr> flights and MOD would meet the cost of the
cancelled flights. However, this would count as one of the child’s SCVs.</p>

<p>In this scenario, parents could decide to cancel the flight back to the UK and re-arrange for a later date once the school re-opens or travel advice changes. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re-booking would be met by the MOD.</p>

<p>In this scenario, parents would be permitted to cancel the flight back to the overseas area and re-arrange for a later date once the official advice permitted travel. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re-booking would be met by the MOD. There is no entitlement to subsistence or hotel costs during reverse SCVs (but see provisions at para c. above for subsistence during a mandatory self-isolation period on arrival in UK). Any questions from displaced families should be directed through Chain of Command who will provide advice on assistance in these circumstances.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to change travel plans because of advice from the <a href="www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a>, advice from the children’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled and the costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the MOD.

What if a child cannot travel to the overseas assignment area due to official travel advice and the parent cannot travel to the UK due to official travel advice?</h3>

<p>The cost of return travel from the child’s school to a Guardian’s address4 in the UK may be claimed (JSP 752 para 10.0211) less the normal parental contribution. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians)3 is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the COVID-19 restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is with the Guardian and the parent is not present.</p>

<p>They are unable to join a designated Guardian for valid reasons (e.g. the Guardian is self-isolating) and continue to be accommodated at their school. In this case, where the child remains at the school outwith the normal academic term times, CEA claimants will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees providing they are proportionate to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p>

        "text": "<p>1.\nI am directed to inform you of the following enhanced interim arrangements for School Children’s Visits (SCVs) in response to Coronavirus (COVID-19) and border control restrictions. This replaces the <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> DLs issued on 9 and 16 March 2020 and the DL issued on border restrictions dated 4 June 2020 which are now rescinded. These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Rem Allowances. UK self-isolation requirements are set out in the Government guidance available on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/ukborder-control\" class=\"govuk-link\">gov.uk Border Control page</a>.</p><p>2.\n<abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> policy has been reviewed to provide further flexibility to allow parents to manage SCVs under challenging conditions. Policy changes now allow for reverse SCVs for both parents to return to the UK for the Christmas 2020 end of term holiday period where COVID-19 restrictions in the UK and/or the overseas assignment area, or lack of UNMIN service, mean travel overseas for the child is impracticable. Subsistence for any mandatory self-isolation period is also now permitted subject to the caveats described in the scenarios at the Annex to this DL. This applies to the October 2020 and February 2021 half term and Christmas 2020 end of term school holidays as well as to any mandatory self-isolation associated with school closures during term time. Where a <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> would normally be from UK to the overseas assignment area, but one or both parents are now temporarily living in the UK due to evacuation or unable to return due to COVID-19 restrictions a <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> within the UK can now be permitted in lieu of the normal overseas <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr>.</p><p>3.\nThe provisions are listed at the Annex to this DL and should be read alongside JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits. It is emphasised that SP should submit any flight booking requests as soon as possible. Flights, where they are operating, may be limited and subject to the risk of cancellation.</p><p>4.\nIt is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times, including whilst on SCVs. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area and make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href=\"www.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\">UK Government</a> as well as any host nation guidance and arrangements.</p><p>5.\nThe guidance on Accompanied Status (JSP 752, Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 2) requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (RWA) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their accompanied status will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (CO). If the exceptional circumstances relating to COVID-19 cause (or contribute to) the spouse/civil partner being absent from the RWA in excess of 90 days, the CO should acknowledge this during their assessment of the claimant’s accompanied status. Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any COVID-19 related travel restrictions are reversed1.</p><p>6.\nThe arrangements in this DL do not extend to children over the age of 18 attending a nationally accredited establishment and entitled to SCVs under the terms of JSP 752 10.0210 b. Reverse visits are not normally permitted for children in this category. However, for the end of term Christmas 2020 holiday period only, a reverse <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> for one parent will be permitted. In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p><p>7.\nFor children over the age of 18 with Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND), or with complex needs requiring specialist support (see JSP 752 10.0210 c. and d.) the provisions of this DL will apply.</p><p>8.\nThe terms of this DL will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by AF Rem Allowances. The additional costs associated with the arrangements covered in this DL should be recorded so that they are available should this information be required at a later date.\nAHd Allowances Defence People AF Remuneration.</p>"

Should a parent consider this to be the preferred option for them during the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period, then a reverse <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> may be authorised for both parents and any accompanying members of the immediate family1 in lieu of one <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> for each eligible child.

However, where a reverse <abbr title=\"school children’s visit\">SCV</abbr> is necessary, and there is a mandatory self-isolation period applied by the UK Government on travellers from the country the SP is assigned to, subsistence allowance may be claimed for the duration of the self-isolation period only as detailed below. Where this is applicable it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible; however it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family.</p><p>The Government or devolved administrations’ COVID 19 restrictions may also limit options for some families (e.g. rule of 6 etc). SP should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options for mandatory self-isolation have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order, starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1).</p><h4 id=\"parents-and-children-to-use-the-service-cotswold-centre-or-welfare-housing\">1. Parent(s) and child(ren) to use the Service Cotswold Centre or welfare housing.</h4><p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There would not be a second accommodation charge incurred to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation; from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.

If full board is not available then actual costs up to the normal UK daily subsistence rate can be claimed for each day, for the parents and each child, for the mandatory self-isolation period only. JSP 752, Chapter 5, Para 05.0108 refers. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school; and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b(3)).

The following options for subsistence should be considered, and it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However, it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family.</p><p>The Government or devolved administrations’ COVID 19 restrictions may also limit options for some families (e.g. rule of 6 etc).

Defence Business Services (DBS) will process claims allowing SP to be reimbursed above normal CEA ceilings. CEA claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)).

Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians)3 is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the COVID-19 restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is self-isolating with the Guardian and the parent is not present. Where it is necessary for the parent to remain with the child(ren) at the home of the Guardian for all or part of the mandatory self-isolation period, then PAR may be claimed.</p><p>Only one PAR claim is permissible per night per family and Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) is not payable on nights when PAR is claimed. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted for: the parent to transport the child to the home of the guardian, to take the child to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)).
