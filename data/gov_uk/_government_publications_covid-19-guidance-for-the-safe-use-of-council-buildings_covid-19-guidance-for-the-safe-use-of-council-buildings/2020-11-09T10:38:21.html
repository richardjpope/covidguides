<p>Please note: This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This information is for those managing council buildings. It signposts to relevant guidance on a range of different activities that can take place in these spaces, in line with measures to tackle COVID-19.</p>

<p>Each council will need to apply relevant guidance locally depending on circumstances, including its size and type of activities, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated. This guidance applies to all users of council buildings including visitors and councillors.</p>

<p>From Thursday 5 November national COVID-19 restrictions will apply to England, this includes actions that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Require people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Prevent people gathering with people they do not live with, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Close certain businesses and venues.</li>
</ol>

<p>When reading this guidance, you should also review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" class="govuk-link">guidance on New National restrictions</a>.</p>

<p>Many council buildings are also workplaces and should therefore be aware of their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">responsibilities as employers</a>. To help contain the virus, everyone who can work effectively from home must do so. Where people cannot do so (for instance people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing) they should continue to travel to work/attend their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting vital sectors and employers.</p>

<p>To help decide which actions to take, a COVID-19 risk assessment should be completed by each operator of a council building, civic building, town hall or organiser of a civic event. This will be in addition to any risk assessment which is already in place. See guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm" class="govuk-link">completing a risk assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Public sector employees working in essential services, including education settings, should continue to go into work . The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" class="govuk-link">new national restrictions guidance</a> for information.</p>

<h2 id="core-principles-for-safely-reopening-council-buildings">
<span class="number">2. </span> Core principles for safely reopening council buildings</h2>

<p>Council buildings are used for a range of purposes, and relevant guidance on specific activities is signposted below (section 3).</p>

<p>Ultimately, those using these spaces are responsible for ensuring their activity is conducted safely and within relevant guidelines. However, there are general principles that managers of council buildings should consider.</p>

<p>Any opening plans must be consistent with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidance" class="govuk-link">Core public health guidance</a> regarding health, hygiene, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#other-businesses-and-venues" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Safe workplace guidelines</a>, to ensure employees are safe to return to work</li>
  <li>Any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" class="govuk-link">national restrictions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From Thursday 5 November national COVID-19 restrictions will apply to England, this includes actions that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Require people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Prevent people gathering with people they do not live with, except for specific purposes.</li>
  <li>Close certain businesses and venues.</li>
</ol>

<p>When reading this guidance, you should also review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" class="govuk-link">guidance on New National restrictions</a>.</p>

<p>To help decide which actions to take prior to opening the building for permitted activity, a <strong>COVID-19 risk assessment should be completed</strong>. This will be in addition to any risk assessment which is already in place for the community facility. See guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm" class="govuk-link">completing a risk assessment</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, 2 metres, or 1 metre with risk mitigation (where 2 metres is not viable), are acceptable for distances for people to be from each other. You should consider and set out the mitigations you will introduce in your risk assessment.</p>

<h3 id="face-coverings">Face coverings</h3>

<p>You must wear a face covering by law in some public places unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition.</p>

<p>You are also strongly encouraged to wear a face covering in other enclosed public spaces where social distancing may be difficult and where you come into contact with people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>From 23 September, there will be additional venues and areas where it will be mandatory to wear a face covering, unless you have an exemption. Please see the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<p>From 24 September, staff in retail and hospitality settings will be required to wear a face covering and all businesses must remind customers to wear a face covering where mandated, e.g by displaying posters.</p>

<p>Further information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social contact rules, social distancing and the exemptions that exist</a>.</p>

<h3 id="test-and-trace">Test and Trace</h3>

<p>An overview of NHS Test and Trace, including what happens if you test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive, can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace guidance</a>. We will be mandating that organisations in designated sectors must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors to provide their name and contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can â€˜check inâ€™ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adhere to General Data Protection Regulations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.</p>

<p>You can find out more about these requirements: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a></p>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or the local authority, identifies employers and building managers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Under health and safety legislation, failure to complete a COVID-19 risk assessment would constitute a breach, as would having a risk assessment with insufficient measures.  The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers and building managers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.  Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with large fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authority. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UKâ€™s fight against COVID-19 by working with the government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<h3 id="waste-disposal-in-non-healthcare-settings">Waste disposal in non-healthcare settings</h3>

<p>The key points of the waste disposal guidance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People should dispose of face coverings and PPE in a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin. People should not put face coverings or PPE in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</li>
  <li>People who are self-isolating, and members of their household, should double bag face coverings and items of PPE to be disposed of, and store them for 72 hours before putting them in a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin.</li>
  <li>Businesses should provide extra bins for staff and customers to throw away face coverings and PPE, and should ensure that staff and customers do not use a recycling bin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> for further details.</p>

<h2 id="council-buildings-signposting-to-relevant-guidance">
<span class="number">3. </span> Council buildings: signposting to relevant guidance</h2>

<p>Those managing council buildings, and those planning civic events, should take account of the relevant guidance below. This guidance signposts to the guidance available to support operators to safely manage council buildings during the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="a-office-space">
<span class="number">3a: </span> Office space</h3>

<p>To help contain the virus, everyone who can work effectively from home must do so. Where people cannot do so (for instance people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing) they should continue to travel to work/attend their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting vital sectors and employers. Public sector employees working in essential services, including education settings, should continue to go into work .

</ul>

<p>The principles set out in the â€˜Safer workplacesâ€™ guidance apply but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meetings of civic, political or community groups (e.g. parish council meeting, ward meeting of political party; charity board of trustees)</li>
  <li>MP or councillor surgery/drop-in sessions</li>
  <li>public meetings and local consultations (e.g. planning)</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities in England still have the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/392/contents/made" class="govuk-link">powers</a> to hold public meetings virtually by using video or telephone conferencing technology.</p>

<p>And the Local Government Association have on their <a rel="external" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/guidance-and-resources/remote-council-meetings" class="govuk-link">website</a> a hub with contributions from a range of sector representative organisations providing advice and support with the management of remote meetings.</p>

<h3 id="d-common-areas">
<span class="number">3d: </span> Common areas</h3>

<p>Council buildings and town halls often rely on shared facilities for workersï¿¼ and occupants to access, including canteens and lifts. Guidance on moving around buildings and common areas can be found in below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/offices-and-contact-centres" class="govuk-link">Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19): Offices and contact centres</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="e-toilets">
<span class="number">3e: </span> Toilets</h3>

<p>Public toilets, portable toilets and toilets inside premises should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency and to avoid touching your face, and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available.</li>
  <li>Consider the use of social distancing marking in areas where queues normally form, and the adoption of a limited entry approach, with one in, one out (whilst avoiding the creation of additional bottlenecks).</li>
  <li>To enable good hand hygiene consider making hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical, and ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand driers) are available.</li>
  <li>Setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces.</li>
  <li>Keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</li>
  <li>Putting up a visible cleaning schedule can keep it up to date and visible.</li>
  <li>Providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="g-travel">
<span class="number">3g: </span> Travel</h3>

<p>Before opening council buildings, operators should think about how manage pedestrian space, pedestrian movement, queues and traffic.</p>

<p>Car parks are permitted to be open where needed and councils should consider practical measures such as changing the car park layout to help people socially distance. Decisions to reopen car parks are to be made locally.</p>

<p>Guidance on social distancing relevant to transport, parking and the public realm can be found below. Face coverings are now <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-safe-outside-your-home/staying-safe-outside-your-home#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">mandatory on public transport</a>.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

It signposts to relevant guidance on a range of different activities that can take place in these spaces, in line with measures to tackle COVID-19.</p><p>Each council will need to apply relevant guidance locally depending on circumstances, including its size and type of activities, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated. This guidance applies to all users of council buildings including visitors and councillors.</p><p>From Thursday 5 November national COVID-19 restrictions will apply to England, this includes actions that:</p><ol>\n  <li>Require people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.</li>\n  <li>Prevent people gathering with people they do not live with, except for specific purposes.</li>\n  <li>Close certain businesses and venues.</li>\n</ol><p>When reading this guidance, you should also review the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on New National restrictions</a>.</p><p>Many council buildings are also workplaces and should therefore be aware of their <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\">responsibilities as employers</a>. To help contain the virus, everyone who can work effectively from home must do so. Where people cannot do so (for instance people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing) they should continue to travel to work/attend their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting vital sectors and employers.</p><p>To help decide which actions to take, a COVID-19 risk assessment should be completed by each operator of a council building, civic building, town hall or organiser of a civic event. This will be in addition to any risk assessment which is already in place. See guidance on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm\" class=\"govuk-link\">completing a risk assessment</a>.</p><p>Public sector employees working in essential services, including education settings, should continue to go into work . The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november\" class=\"govuk-link\">new national restrictions guidance</a> for information.</p>"

        "text": "<p>Council buildings are used for a range of purposes, and relevant guidance on specific activities is signposted below (section 3).</p><p>Ultimately, those using these spaces are responsible for ensuring their activity is conducted safely and within relevant guidelines. However, there are general principles that managers of council buildings should consider.</p><p>Any opening plans must be consistent with:</p><ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\">Core public health guidance</a> regarding health, hygiene, and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#other-businesses-and-venues\" class=\"govuk-link\">social distancing</a>\n</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\">Safe workplace guidelines</a>, to ensure employees are safe to return to work</li>\n  <li>Any <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november\" class=\"govuk-link\">national restrictions</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>From Thursday 5 November national COVID-19 restrictions will apply to England, this includes actions that:</p><ol>\n  <li>Require people to stay at home, except for specific purposes.</li>\n  <li>Prevent people gathering with people they do not live with, except for specific purposes.</li>\n  <li>Close certain businesses and venues.</li>\n</ol><p>When reading this guidance, you should also review the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on New National restrictions</a>.</p><p>To help decide which actions to take prior to opening the building for permitted activity, a <strong>COVID-19 risk assessment should be completed</strong>. This will be in addition to any risk assessment which is already in place for the community facility. See guidance on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm\" class=\"govuk-link\">completing a risk assessment</a>.</p><p>In addition, 2 metres, or 1 metre with risk mitigation (where 2 metres is not viable), are acceptable for distances for people to be from each other. You should consider and set out the mitigations you will introduce in your risk assessment.</p><h3 id=\"face-coverings\">Face coverings</h3><p>You must wear a face covering by law in some public places unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition.</p><p>You are also strongly encouraged to wear a face covering in other enclosed public spaces where social distancing may be difficult and where you come into contact with people you do not normally meet.</p><p>From 23 September, there will be additional venues and areas where it will be mandatory to wear a face covering, unless you have an exemption. Please see the latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on face coverings</a>.</p><p>From 24 September, staff in retail and hospitality settings will be required to wear a face covering and all businesses must remind customers to wear a face covering where mandated, e.g by displaying posters.</p><p>Further information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing\" class=\"govuk-link\">social contact rules, social distancing and the exemptions that exist</a>.</p><h3 id=\"test-and-trace\">Test and Trace</h3><p>An overview of NHS Test and Trace, including what happens if you test positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive, can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works\" class=\"govuk-link\">NHS Test and Trace guidance</a>. We will be mandating that organisations in designated sectors must:</p><ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors to provide their name and contact details</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can â€˜check inâ€™ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>adhere to General Data Protection Regulations</p>\n  </li>\n</ul><p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p><p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.</p><p>You can find out more about these requirements: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace\" class=\"govuk-link\">Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace</a></p><h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3><p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or the local authority, identifies employers and building managers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p><p>Under health and safety legislation, failure to complete a COVID-19 risk assessment would constitute a breach, as would having a risk assessment with insufficient measures.  The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers and building managers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.  Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with large fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years.</p><p>Employers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authority. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UKâ€™s fight against COVID-19 by working with the government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p><h3 id=\"waste-disposal-in-non-healthcare-settings\">Waste disposal in non-healthcare settings</h3><p>The key points of the waste disposal guidance are:</p><ul>\n  <li>People should dispose of face coverings and PPE in a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin. People should not put face coverings or PPE in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</li>\n  <li>People who are self-isolating, and members of their household, should double bag face coverings and items of PPE to be disposed of, and store them for 72 hours before putting them in a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin.</li>\n  <li>Businesses should provide extra bins for staff and customers to throw away face coverings and PPE, and should ensure that staff and customers do not use a recycling bin.</li>\n</ul><p>Please see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance</a> for further details.</p>"
