<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As restrictions ease and the country begins to reopen, countryside and coastal areas of the country are experiencing increasing numbers of visitors, particularly as we approach warmer weather. Government welcomes the return of visitors to our vibrant tourist areas and recognises the important role this has in supporting these local economies.</p>

<p>Whilst the return of tourism is welcome, it is recognised that this has also created challenges when considered alongside the need to manage public places, facilities and businesses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In order to support owners and operators in these areas in meeting these challenges, this guidance has been created to bring together relevant existing government advice and policy to support the owners and operators in beach, countryside and coastal areas of the country, enabling easy access to information on addressing these issues. The guidance and advice contained within will help these areas to operate while remaining COVID-19 Secure and tackle the associated issues of high volumes of visitors such as overcrowding, littering, and public facilities provision.</p>

<p><strong>This document is up to date as of 12 October 2020. This document will be updated with further relevant guidance and information as it becomes available.</strong></p>

<h2>How to use this document</h2>

<p>This page has been divided into 3 sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#COVID-19-secure-guidance" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 secure guidance/Other government guidance/interventions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#external-guidance" class="govuk-link">Externally produced guidance</a></li>
  <li><a href="#UK-International" class="govuk-link">Examples of UK and International practice</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Each section has been subdivided by the issue that the material is aimed at addressing.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, the guidance linked within this compendium applies to England only. Public Health is devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Owners and operators in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should refer to guidance published by the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link">Scottish Government</a>, the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Welsh Government</a> and the <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland Executive</a> respectively.</p>

<p>On 12 October the government introduced a system of local COVID alert levels. If you live, work or volunteer in an area that is part of local COVID alert level - high or local COVID alert level - very high, there are additional restrictions which apply to you. Please visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">local COVID alert levels page</a> to find out what level your area is in and the additional restrictions that apply.</p>

<h3>Supporting social distancing and tackling overcrowding</h3>
<p>The following information has been collated to support owners and operators of beaches, countryside and coastal destinations with implementing measures and processes to support social distancing and ensure effective crowd management. It is important to also consider the security implications of any changes to operations and practices.</p>

<h3>Dealing with antisocial behaviour/enforcement</h3>

<p>The increase in visitors to beach, countryside and coastal areas may have created an increase in isolated incidents of antisocial behaviours such as littering, public defecation/urination, and drunk and disorderly behaviour.</p>

<p>The <strong>Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014</strong> provides the police, local authorities and other local agencies with a range of flexible tools and powers that they can use to respond quickly and effectively to antisocial behaviour. Front line practitioners managing incidents of antisocial behaviour should continue to follow core public health guidance.</p>

<p>Further information can be found within the links below.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Toilets and public facilities management including waste management and car parking</h3>

<p>Providing public facilities such as toilets, car parking and bins can help to mitigate associated antisocial behaviour such as littering, public defecation, and illegal parking.</p>

<h4>Waste management</h4>

<p>Residual “black bag” litter bins should be provided for visitors to dispose of used face coverings or PPE, such as gloves. Bins should be emptied frequently. Further information on disposing of personal or business waste can be found below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: disposing of waste</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Toilets and public facilities</h4>

<p>Government has produced guidance, principles and measures that can be taken, to manage public toilets and keep them clean to minimise COVID-19 transmission risk.</p>

<p>The advice below is included in a variety of government guidance:</p>

<p><strong>Objective: To ensure that toilets are kept open and to promote good hygiene, social distancing, and cleanliness in toilet facilities</strong></p>

<p>Public toilets, portable toilets and toilets inside premises should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency and to avoid touch your face, and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available</li>
  <li>consider the use of social distancing marking in areas where queues normally form, and the adoption of a limited entry approach, with one in, one out (whilst avoiding the creation of additional bottlenecks)</li>
  <li>to enable good hand hygiene consider making hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical, and ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand driers) are available</li>
  <li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces</li>
  <li>keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate</li>
  <li>special care should be taken for cleaning or portable toilets and larger toilet blocks</li>
  <li>putting up a visible cleaning schedule and keep it up to date and visible</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cleaning in non-healthcare settings</h3>

<p>In cases where Covid-19 has been present, there is guidance on cleaning non-healthcare settings:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">PHE: Cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Car parking</h3>

<p>Information for local authorities on enforcing parking restrictions, to maintain access for emergency services, residents’ vehicles and pedestrians, can be found below.</p>

</ul>

<p>On 25 June, government temporarily extended the length of time for which permitted development rights can be used to allow anyone to use land for any purpose in a single year. From the beginning of July until the end of December 2020, the length of time that land can be used for any purpose is now 56 days (or 28 days with respect holding a market or for motor sports).</p>

<p>Local authorities may wish to consider how the <strong>temporary changes to permitted development rights</strong> can support management of their areas.</p>

<p>Further information on the temporary changes can be found below.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Safety/emergency access</h3>

<p>Visitors must be made aware if there is a reduction in lifeguard or mountain rescue services so they can manage their own risk.</p>

<p>The information and links to information below can help owners and operators in these areas in ensuring safety and emergency access is maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as communicating with visitors on how to keep safe.</p>

<h3>Supporting the tourist economy to reopen safely</h3>

<p>To help the local economies of beach, countryside and coastal areas reopen as regulatory restrictions are eased, the following guidance has been produced and interventions made by government.</p>

<p>Businesses within these areas should consult the relevant COVID-19 Secure guidance to assist them in identifying and taking steps to reopen safely. Any reopening plans should be consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidance" class="govuk-link">core public health guidance</a> regarding health, hygiene and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing-after-4-july" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a>. All businesses will need to conduct a risk assessment that takes account of COVID-19 ahead of reopening.</p>

<h3>The High Streets Taskforce</h3>

<p>The High Streets Task Force was established by government to strengthen local leadership and provide high streets and town centres with expert advice to adapt and thrive.</p>

<p>The High Streets Task Force is hosted externally by the Institute of Place Management.</p>

<p>The High Streets Task Force has created a range of resources to support high streets and town centres in adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic. See the <a href="https://www.highstreetstaskforce.org.uk/resources" class="govuk-link">library of resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To note</strong>, resources created by the High Streets Task Force have been created by independent experts on behalf of the High Streets Task Force. It is not intended as government guidance and the High Streets Task Force has not sought approval for it to be so.</p>

<h2>Examples of UK and international practice</h2>

<p>The examples provided below are to illustrate how local areas have chosen to adapt their individual local experiences. This examples are indicative and do not imply a preferred approach by government.</p>

<h3>UK examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>West Wittering</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In West Wittering, a <strong>local beach ticketing system</strong> has been implemented using the Just Park app. Visitors to West Wittering beach must book their parking slot ahead of time. This has helped to control the numbers of visitors to the beach, and thus mitigate associated issues of high visitor numbers. West Wittering continues to work with local authorities to address some of the concerns that illegal parking has caused. Visit <a href="http://westwitteringestate.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">http://westwitteringestate.co.uk/</a> for further information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Brighton and Hove</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In Brighton and Hove, the council has <strong>temporarily closed Madeira Drive</strong> to motor vehicle traffic to open the sea front promenade for <strong>greater pedestrian</strong> use. The area will be stewarded from 8am to 8pm daily to ensure that businesses will maintain essential access to their properties, while maximising the usage of the area for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

<p>In addition, in response to the recent increase in littering the council has <strong>installed new large bins</strong> to encourage visitors to dispose of their waste properly, <strong>increased bin collections</strong>, and <strong>extended enforcement officer patrols</strong> by an extra hour to tackle the worst offenders. Enforcement officers are able to issue on the spot £150 fines to members of the public. The council has also employed extra staff to clear litter on the seafront and in parks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UK National Parks</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>At national parks such as the <a href="https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Lake District National Park</a>, <a href="https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/weekend-car-parks/" class="govuk-link">the Yorkshire Dales</a> and <a href="https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/places-to-visit/car-park-status" class="govuk-link">the Peak District</a>, <strong>live updates on car parking availability are provided via the website</strong>. In the Lake District National Park, these updates also include <strong>information on whether toilet facilities are provided</strong> via the website to help the public plan their trip and know what is available before they leave their home and on their journey. Roadside signage directs travellers to check the status of their chosen destination. Daily multi-agency patrols mean the latest information can be shared with the public and ensure that visitor numbers are kept to a level that enables tourists to visit the area while maintaining social distancing. A website was created to make it easier for visitors to find guidance on visiting safely (<a href="http://www.saferlakes.co.uk" class="govuk-link">saferlakes.co.uk</a>). Over 150,000 people used the page in the first month.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Folkestone and Hythe</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The district council is tackling littering and wildfires by <strong>installing additional large bins, banning the use of BBQs in the Coastal Park</strong>, and installing <strong>new lockable gates</strong> to close the Coastal Park from 8pm to 8am to discourage people from staying in the area until late evening. The council is also refreshing double yellow lines and consulting on resident parking schemes in the area to discourage obstructive and illegal parking following issues regarding emergency service access.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>St. Ives</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In St. Ives, a partnership between the Town Council, Cornwall Council BID and the harbour master <strong>has implemented road closures and traffic restrictions between the hours of 11am and 4pm</strong> to remove all but essential vehicles from the town’s streets. The council is urging visitors to access the town by foot between these times to help maintain social distancing through increased pedestrianisation.</p>

<h3>International examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Benidorm, Spain</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ropes have been used to <strong>divide beaches into sections</strong> catering for groups of 4 people per area. Some sections, marked in a different colour, are <strong>reserved for the over 70s</strong>. Other sections are reserved for a beach licensee who is allowed to install a number of sunbeds for hire. Beach users are expected to wear a mask where social distancing is not possible (e.g. walking to the beach) but are able to remove it once in their section of the beach area. Beach users are able to reserve their beach spots via an app or in person through information centres; though this system will not begin until beaches become crowded.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sweden</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Towns with beaches plan to <strong>invest in information campaigns and extra cleaning of public toilets</strong>. They will ask staff working on piers and beaches to take responsibility for controlling visitor numbers and encouraging social distancing. The town of Ystad plans to <strong>hire members of the public as marshals</strong> to remind visitors of the social distancing rules in place.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Italy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sunbeds have been placed apart from each to promote social distancing, with ropes to cordon off the area around them</strong>. Ropes are also being used to cordon off one-way walkways to the sea and also off the beach. To avoid queues at food and drink vendors, some beaches, such as Porto Cesareo are offering <strong>to serve refreshments to people at their spot on the beach</strong>. Others such as Sardinia’s La Pelosa will use a <strong>ticketing system</strong> to control visitor numbers.</p>

Government welcomes the return of visitors to our vibrant tourist areas and recognises the important role this has in supporting these local economies.</p><p>Whilst the return of tourism is welcome, it is recognised that this has also created challenges when considered alongside the need to manage public places, facilities and businesses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In order to support owners and operators in these areas in meeting these challenges, this guidance has been created to bring together relevant existing government advice and policy to support the owners and operators in beach, countryside and coastal areas of the country, enabling easy access to information on addressing these issues. The guidance and advice contained within will help these areas to operate while remaining COVID-19 Secure and tackle the associated issues of high volumes of visitors such as overcrowding, littering, and public facilities provision.</p><p><strong>This document is up to date as of 12 October 2020.

Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces</li>\n  <li>keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate</li>\n  <li>special care should be taken for cleaning or portable toilets and larger toilet blocks</li>\n  <li>putting up a visible cleaning schedule and keep it up to date and visible</li>\n  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"cleaning-in-non-healthcare-settings\">Cleaning in non-healthcare settings</h3><p>In cases where Covid-19 has been present, there is guidance on cleaning non-healthcare settings:</p><ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings\" class=\"govuk-link\">PHE: Cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a></li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"car-parking\">Car parking</h3><p>Information for local authorities on enforcing parking restrictions, to maintain access for emergency services, residents’ vehicles and pedestrians, can be found below.</p><ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-enforcement-of-parking-contraventions\" class=\"govuk-link\">How local authorities should enforce parking restrictions</a></li>\n</ul><p>On 25 June, government temporarily extended the length of time for which permitted development rights can be used to allow anyone to use land for any purpose in a single year.

This examples are indicative and do not imply a preferred approach by government.</p><h3 id=\"uk-examples\">UK examples</h3><ul>\n  <li><strong>West Wittering</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In West Wittering, a <strong>local beach ticketing system</strong> has been implemented using the Just Park app. Visitors to West Wittering beach must book their parking slot ahead of time. This has helped to control the numbers of visitors to the beach, and thus mitigate associated issues of high visitor numbers. West Wittering continues to work with local authorities to address some of the concerns that illegal parking has caused. Visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://westwitteringestate.co.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\">http://westwitteringestate.co.uk/</a> for further information.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>Brighton and Hove</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In Brighton and Hove, the council has <strong>temporarily closed Madeira Drive</strong> to motor vehicle traffic to open the sea front promenade for <strong>greater pedestrian</strong> use. The area will be stewarded from 8am to 8pm daily to ensure that businesses will maintain essential access to their properties, while maximising the usage of the area for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>In addition, in response to the recent increase in littering the council has <strong>installed new large bins</strong> to encourage visitors to dispose of their waste properly, <strong>increased bin collections</strong>, and <strong>extended enforcement officer patrols</strong> by an extra hour to tackle the worst offenders. Enforcement officers are able to issue on the spot £150 fines to members of the public. The council has also employed extra staff to clear litter on the seafront and in parks.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>UK National Parks</strong></li>\n</ul><p>At national parks such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/coronavirus\" class=\"govuk-link\">Lake District National Park</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/weekend-car-parks/\" class=\"govuk-link\">the Yorkshire Dales</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/places-to-visit/car-park-status\" class=\"govuk-link\">the Peak District</a>, <strong>live updates on car parking availability are provided via the website</strong>. In the Lake District National Park, these updates also include <strong>information on whether toilet facilities are provided</strong> via the website to help the public plan their trip and know what is available before they leave their home and on their journey. Roadside signage directs travellers to check the status of their chosen destination. Daily multi-agency patrols mean the latest information can be shared with the public and ensure that visitor numbers are kept to a level that enables tourists to visit the area while maintaining social distancing. A website was created to make it easier for visitors to find guidance on visiting safely (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.saferlakes.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\">saferlakes.co.uk</a>). Over 150,000 people used the page in the first month.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>Folkestone and Hythe</strong></li>\n</ul><p>The district council is tackling littering and wildfires by <strong>installing additional large bins, banning the use of BBQs in the Coastal Park</strong>, and installing <strong>new lockable gates</strong> to close the Coastal Park from 8pm to 8am to discourage people from staying in the area until late evening. The council is also refreshing double yellow lines and consulting on resident parking schemes in the area to discourage obstructive and illegal parking following issues regarding emergency service access.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>St. Ives</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In St. Ives, a partnership between the Town Council, Cornwall Council BID and the harbour master <strong>has implemented road closures and traffic restrictions between the hours of 11am and 4pm</strong> to remove all but essential vehicles from the town’s streets. The council is urging visitors to access the town by foot between these times to help maintain social distancing through increased pedestrianisation.</p><h3 id=\"international-examples\">International examples</h3><ul>\n  <li><strong>Benidorm, Spain</strong></li>\n</ul><p>Ropes have been used to <strong>divide beaches into sections</strong> catering for groups of 4 people per area. Some sections, marked in a different colour, are <strong>reserved for the over 70s</strong>. Other sections are reserved for a beach licensee who is allowed to install a number of sunbeds for hire. Beach users are expected to wear a mask where social distancing is not possible (e.g. walking to the beach) but are able to remove it once in their section of the beach area. Beach users are able to reserve their beach spots via an app or in person through information centres; though this system will not begin until beaches become crowded.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>Sweden</strong></li>\n</ul><p>Towns with beaches plan to <strong>invest in information campaigns and extra cleaning of public toilets</strong>. They will ask staff working on piers and beaches to take responsibility for controlling visitor numbers and encouraging social distancing. The town of Ystad plans to <strong>hire members of the public as marshals</strong> to remind visitors of the social distancing rules in place.</p><ul>\n  <li><strong>Italy</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Sunbeds have been placed apart from each to promote social distancing, with ropes to cordon off the area around them</strong>. Ropes are also being used to cordon off one-way walkways to the sea and also off the beach. To avoid queues at food and drink vendors, some beaches, such as Porto Cesareo are offering <strong>to serve refreshments to people at their spot on the beach</strong>. Others such as Sardinia’s La Pelosa will use a <strong>ticketing system</strong> to control visitor numbers.</p>"
