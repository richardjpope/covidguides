<p><strong>What is the purpose of this written ministerial statement?</strong></p>

<p>On 14 July 2020, the government published a <a rel="external" href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2020-07-14/HLWS359/" class="govuk-link">written ministerial statement</a> to support the culture and tourism sectors by both preventing the loss of theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues, and encouraging local planning authorities to exercise their discretion in relation to planning conditions for caravan, campsites and holiday parks. This statement sets out the approach local planning authorities should take to decision making for these venues that have been made temporarily vacant by Covid-19 business disruption. The statement also encourages local planning authorities not to undertake enforcement action which would unnecessarily restrict the ability of caravan, campsites and holiday parks to extend their open season.</p>

<p>The statement comes into effect on 14 July 2020 and will remain in place until 31 December 2022 unless superseded by a further statement.</p>

<h2 id="decision-making-in-relation-to-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-music-performance-venues">Decision-making in relation to theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-a-live-music-performance-venue">What is a live music performance venue?</h3>

<p>For the purpose of this statement, live music performance venues are land or buildings wholly or mainly used for the performance of live music for the purpose of entertaining an audience. This can include grassroots music venues where the performance of live music is the primary use.</p>

<p>Land or buildings where the primary use is not the performance of live music (e.g. a restaurant or public house) should not be considered a live music performance venue.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-the-statutory-consultees-for-these-venues">Who are the statutory consultees for these venues?</h3>

<p>The Theatres Trust is a statutory consultee under the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (S.I 2015/595) for applications seeking to develop any land where there is a theatre and will have an opportunity to comment on any application relating to theatres.</p>

<p>The Music Venue Trust is not a statutory consultee, but local planning authorities may wish to consult them when considering applications for change of use or demolition of a live music performance venue.</p>

<h3 id="in-what-circumstances-does-this-statement-apply">In what circumstances does this statement apply?</h3>
<p>This statement applies to theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues where their primary use has been temporarily discontinued as a result of Covid-19 business disruption. This includes venues where a tenant has experienced business failures as a result of Covid-19, but where the venue would otherwise support a commercially viable business.</p>

<h3 id="does-this-statement-apply-to-venues-that-have-been-long-term-vacant">Does this statement apply to venues that have been long term vacant?</h3>
<p>Where the primary use of a venue has become permanently discontinued or discontinuance is unrelated to Covid-19 business disruption, applications for change of use or demolition should be considered in the normal way. Access <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/effective-use-of-land" class="govuk-link">guidance on supporting more effective use of land</a></p>

<h3 id="is-the-secretary-of-state-still-able-to-call-in-applications-for-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-music-performance-venues">Is the Secretary of State still able to call-in applications for theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues?</h3>
<p>Yes. Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 empowers the Secretary of State to call in a planning application for his own determination. The power can be exercised at any time up to planning permission being issued by a local planning authority. The Secretary of State will normally only do this if the application conflicts with national policy in important ways, or is nationally significant.</p>

<h2 id="future-changes-to-the-general-permitted-development-order">Future changes to the General Permitted Development Order</h2>

<h3 id="what-changes-are-you-making-to-the-general-permitted-development-order">What changes are you making to the General Permitted Development Order?</h3>

<p>We will be removing the permitted development rights under Class B of  Part 11 of Schedule 2 to the Order for the demolition of theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues. In protecting these venues from possible demolition we are extending protections that we have already applied to pubs.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-considered-necessary-to-remove-the-permitted-development-to-demolish-theatres-concert-hall-and-live-music-performance-venues">Why is it considered necessary to remove the permitted development to demolish theatres, concert hall and live music performance venues?</h3>

<p>We always want to strike a balance between planning freedoms where it helps support the economy and those circumstances where greater protection is merited.  It is right that at this time no hasty decisions are made that will see the loss of much loved venues which we want to ensure have the opportunity of a successful future.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-the-changes-to-the-general-permitted-order-be-introduced">When will the changes to the General Permitted Order be introduced?</h3>

<p>We will bring forward legislation to amend the General Permitted Development Order in due course.</p>

<h3 id="are-developers-still-able-to-demolish-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-performance-venues-under-permitted-development-until-changes-to-the-general-permitted-development-order-have-been-made">Are developers still able to demolish theatres, concert halls and live performance venues under permitted development until changes to the General Permitted Development Order have been made?</h3>

<p>Yes. However, any  planning application for change of use or demolition of these venues would need to be considered by local planning authorities in accordance with the provisions set out in the Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<h2 id="extension-to-the-open-season-of-a-caravan-campsite-or-holiday-park-for-a-temporary-period">Extension to the open season of a caravan, campsite or holiday park for a temporary period</h2>

<h3 id="what-should-caravan-campsite-and-holiday-park-owners-do-if-they-wish-to-extend-their-open-season-beyond-the-usual-summer-season-in-the-winter-for-a-temporary-period">What should caravan, campsite and holiday park owners do if they wish to extend their open season beyond the usual summer season in the winter for a temporary period?</h3>

<p>Where the open season of a caravan, campsite or holiday park is limited by planning condition, park owners are encouraged to speak to their local planning authority before submitting an application to extend their opening beyond the usual summer season for a temporary period.</p>

<p>Pre-application engagement can improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning application system and improve the quality of planning applications and their likelihood of success. Local planning authorities can also advise whether a planning application is necessary.</p>

<p>Where there may be particular concerns about flooding or the impact on a protected site, applicants are also encouraged to seek advice from the Environment Agency and Natural England respectively, before submitting an application.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-site-owners-make-an-application">How can site owners make an application?</h3>

<p>Under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, caravan, campsite and holiday parks can submit an application to local planning authorities to vary or remove conditions associated with a planning permission. A successful s.73 application results in the grant of a new planning permission and therefore the original permission remains intact. When determining a s.73 application, the local planning authority  may impose conditions beyond those proposed in the application. However, the conditions imposed should only be ones which could have been imposed on the original grant.</p>

<h3 id="does-a-s73-planning-application-require-an-environmental-impact-assessment">Does a s73 planning application require an Environmental Impact Assessment?</h3>

<p>A section 73 application is considered to be a new application for planning permission under the 2017 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations. The local planning authority will need to determine if an EIA is necessary. Where an EIA was carried out on the original application, the planning authority will need to consider if further information needs to be added to the original Environmental Statement to satisfy the requirements of the EIA Regulations. Whether changes to the original Environmental Statement are required or not, an Environmental Statement must be submitted with a section 73 application for an EIA development.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-local-planning-authorities-do-if-they-receive-an-application-to-vary-planning-conditions-to-permit-opening-beyond-the-usual-summer-season-for-a-temporary-period">What should local planning authorities do if they receive an application to vary planning conditions to permit opening beyond the usual summer season for a temporary period?</h3>

<p>Where local planning authorities consider it appropriate to require an application to vary relevant planning conditions (where for instance there is a risk of flooding or where parks are situated close to protected sites) they should prioritise the application and make an early decision to provide certainty to caravan, campsite and holiday park operators.  In doing so, they should consider the benefits of longer opening season times for a temporary period to the local economy as it recovers from the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<h3 id="who-must-a-local-planning-authority-consult-if-they-receive-an-application">Who must a local planning authority consult if they receive an application?</h3>

<p>Local planning authorities are required to undertake a formal period of public consultation, prior to deciding a planning application. This is prescribed in article 15 of the Development Management Procedure Order (as amended). Depending on the type of development proposed these consultees may include neighbouring landowners, parish councils and relevant statutory consultees.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency are statutory consultees for development, other than minor development that is in Flood Zones 2 and 3, or in Flood Zone 1 which has critical drainage problems. Natural England are statutory consultees for development that is likely to affect a site of special scientific interest.</p>

<h3 id="will-permission-be-granted-if-the-caravan-park-is-in-a-flood-protection-zone-or-near-an-sssi">Will permission be granted if the caravan park is in a flood protection zone, or near an SSSI?</h3>

<p>Statutory consultees and other third parties can suggest conditions to mitigate potential impacts and make a development acceptable in planning terms. The decision as to whether it is appropriate to impose such conditions rests with the local planning authority.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-caravan-site-licences">What does this mean for caravan site licences?</h3>

<p>All existing site licences and any conditions attached to them will remain in force. Local authorities could decide to alter any conditions attached to a licence to reflect any new planning requirements, but this will be subject to consultation with the owner who has a right of appeal against the decision.</p>

<h3 id="do-local-planning-authorities-have-to-take-enforcement-action-if-there-is-a-breach-of-planning-condition">Do local planning authorities have to take enforcement action if there is a breach of planning condition?</h3>

<p>The National Planning Policy Framework already emphasises that planning enforcement is a discretionary activity, and local planning authorities should act proportionately in responding to suspected breaches of planning control. Given the current situation, while local planning authorities must have regard to their legal obligations, they should not seek to undertake planning enforcement action which would unnecessarily restrict the ability of caravan, campsite and holiday parks to extend their open season.</p>

        "text": "<div class=\"govspeak\">\n<p><strong>What is the purpose of this written ministerial statement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>On 14 July 2020, the government published a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2020-07-14/HLWS359/\" class=\"govuk-link\">written ministerial statement</a> to support the culture and tourism sectors by both preventing the loss of theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues, and encouraging local planning authorities to exercise their discretion in relation to planning conditions for caravan, campsites and holiday parks. This statement sets out the approach local planning authorities should take to decision making for these venues that have been made temporarily vacant by Covid-19 business disruption. The statement also encourages local planning authorities not to undertake enforcement action which would unnecessarily restrict the ability of caravan, campsites and holiday parks to extend their open season.</p>\n\n<p>The statement comes into effect on 14 July 2020 and will remain in place until 31 December 2022 unless superseded by a further statement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"decision-making-in-relation-to-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-music-performance-venues\">Decision-making in relation to theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-live-music-performance-venue\">What is a live music performance venue?</h3>\n\n<p>For the purpose of this statement, live music performance venues are land or buildings wholly or mainly used for the performance of live music for the purpose of entertaining an audience. This can include grassroots music venues where the performance of live music is the primary use.</p>\n\n<p>Land or buildings where the primary use is not the performance of live music (e.g. a restaurant or public house) should not be considered a live music performance venue.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-are-the-statutory-consultees-for-these-venues\">Who are the statutory consultees for these venues?</h3>\n\n<p>The Theatres Trust is a statutory consultee under the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (S.I 2015/595) for applications seeking to develop any land where there is a theatre and will have an opportunity to comment on any application relating to theatres.</p>\n\n<p>The Music Venue Trust is not a statutory consultee, but local planning authorities may wish to consult them when considering applications for change of use or demolition of a live music performance venue.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"in-what-circumstances-does-this-statement-apply\">In what circumstances does this statement apply?</h3>\n<p>This statement applies to theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues where their primary use has been temporarily discontinued as a result of Covid-19 business disruption. This includes venues where a tenant has experienced business failures as a result of Covid-19, but where the venue would otherwise support a commercially viable business.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"does-this-statement-apply-to-venues-that-have-been-long-term-vacant\">Does this statement apply to venues that have been long term vacant?</h3>\n<p>Where the primary use of a venue has become permanently discontinued or discontinuance is unrelated to Covid-19 business disruption, applications for change of use or demolition should be considered in the normal way. Access <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/effective-use-of-land\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on supporting more effective use of land</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"is-the-secretary-of-state-still-able-to-call-in-applications-for-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-music-performance-venues\">Is the Secretary of State still able to call-in applications for theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 empowers the Secretary of State to call in a planning application for his own determination. The power can be exercised at any time up to planning permission being issued by a local planning authority. The Secretary of State will normally only do this if the application conflicts with national policy in important ways, or is nationally significant.</p>\n\n<p>See further <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-applications-called-in-decisions-and-recovered-appeals\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on call-in of planning applications</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"future-changes-to-the-general-permitted-development-order\">Future changes to the General Permitted Development Order</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-changes-are-you-making-to-the-general-permitted-development-order\">What changes are you making to the General Permitted Development Order?</h3>\n\n<p>We will be removing the permitted development rights under Class B of  Part 11 of Schedule 2 to the Order for the demolition of theatres, concert halls and live music performance venues. In protecting these venues from possible demolition we are extending protections that we have already applied to pubs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-it-considered-necessary-to-remove-the-permitted-development-to-demolish-theatres-concert-hall-and-live-music-performance-venues\">Why is it considered necessary to remove the permitted development to demolish theatres, concert hall and live music performance venues?</h3>\n\n<p>We always want to strike a balance between planning freedoms where it helps support the economy and those circumstances where greater protection is merited.  It is right that at this time no hasty decisions are made that will see the loss of much loved venues which we want to ensure have the opportunity of a successful future.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-will-the-changes-to-the-general-permitted-order-be-introduced\">When will the changes to the General Permitted Order be introduced?</h3>\n\n<p>We will bring forward legislation to amend the General Permitted Development Order in due course.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-developers-still-able-to-demolish-theatres-concert-halls-and-live-performance-venues-under-permitted-development-until-changes-to-the-general-permitted-development-order-have-been-made\">Are developers still able to demolish theatres, concert halls and live performance venues under permitted development until changes to the General Permitted Development Order have been made?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes. However, any  planning application for change of use or demolition of these venues would need to be considered by local planning authorities in accordance with the provisions set out in the Written Ministerial Statement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extension-to-the-open-season-of-a-caravan-campsite-or-holiday-park-for-a-temporary-period\">Extension to the open season of a caravan, campsite or holiday park for a temporary period</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-should-caravan-campsite-and-holiday-park-owners-do-if-they-wish-to-extend-their-open-season-beyond-the-usual-summer-season-in-the-winter-for-a-temporary-period\">What should caravan, campsite and holiday park owners do if they wish to extend their open season beyond the usual summer season in the winter for a temporary period?</h3>\n\n<p>Where the open season of a caravan, campsite or holiday park is limited by planning condition, park owners are encouraged to speak to their local planning authority before submitting an application to extend their opening beyond the usual summer season for a temporary period.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-application engagement can improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning application system and improve the quality of planning applications and their likelihood of success. Local planning authorities can also advise whether a planning application is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Where there may be particular concerns about flooding or the impact on a protected site, applicants are also encouraged to seek advice from the Environment Agency and Natural England respectively, before submitting an application.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-site-owners-make-an-application\">How can site owners make an application?</h3>\n\n<p>Under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, caravan, campsite and holiday parks can submit an application to local planning authorities to vary or remove conditions associated with a planning permission. A successful s.73 application results in the grant of a new planning permission and therefore the original permission remains intact. When determining a s.73 application, the local planning authority  may impose conditions beyond those proposed in the application. However, the conditions imposed should only be ones which could have been imposed on the original grant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"does-a-s73-planning-application-require-an-environmental-impact-assessment\">Does a s73 planning application require an Environmental Impact Assessment?</h3>\n\n<p>A section 73 application is considered to be a new application for planning permission under the 2017 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations. The local planning authority will need to determine if an EIA is necessary. Where an EIA was carried out on the original application, the planning authority will need to consider if further information needs to be added to the original Environmental Statement to satisfy the requirements of the EIA Regulations. Whether changes to the original Environmental Statement are required or not, an Environmental Statement must be submitted with a section 73 application for an EIA development.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-should-local-planning-authorities-do-if-they-receive-an-application-to-vary-planning-conditions-to-permit-opening-beyond-the-usual-summer-season-for-a-temporary-period\">What should local planning authorities do if they receive an application to vary planning conditions to permit opening beyond the usual summer season for a temporary period?</h3>\n\n<p>Where local planning authorities consider it appropriate to require an application to vary relevant planning conditions (where for instance there is a risk of flooding or where parks are situated close to protected sites) they should prioritise the application and make an early decision to provide certainty to caravan, campsite and holiday park operators.  In doing so, they should consider the benefits of longer opening season times for a temporary period to the local economy as it recovers from the impact of COVID-19.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-must-a-local-planning-authority-consult-if-they-receive-an-application\">Who must a local planning authority consult if they receive an application?</h3>\n\n<p>Local planning authorities are required to undertake a formal period of public consultation, prior to deciding a planning application. This is prescribed in article 15 of the Development Management Procedure Order (as amended). Depending on the type of development proposed these consultees may include neighbouring landowners, parish councils and relevant statutory consultees.</p>\n\n<p>The Environment Agency are statutory consultees for development, other than minor development that is in Flood Zones 2 and 3, or in Flood Zone 1 which has critical drainage problems. Natural England are statutory consultees for development that is likely to affect a site of special scientific interest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"will-permission-be-granted-if-the-caravan-park-is-in-a-flood-protection-zone-or-near-an-sssi\">Will permission be granted if the caravan park is in a flood protection zone, or near an SSSI?</h3>\n\n<p>Statutory consultees and other third parties can suggest conditions to mitigate potential impacts and make a development acceptable in planning terms. The decision as to whether it is appropriate to impose such conditions rests with the local planning authority.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-caravan-site-licences\">What does this mean for caravan site licences?</h3>\n\n<p>All existing site licences and any conditions attached to them will remain in force. Local authorities could decide to alter any conditions attached to a licence to reflect any new planning requirements, but this will be subject to consultation with the owner who has a right of appeal against the decision.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-local-planning-authorities-have-to-take-enforcement-action-if-there-is-a-breach-of-planning-condition\">Do local planning authorities have to take enforcement action if there is a breach of planning condition?</h3>\n\n<p>The National Planning Policy Framework already emphasises that planning enforcement is a discretionary activity, and local planning authorities should act proportionately in responding to suspected breaches of planning control. Given the current situation, while local planning authorities must have regard to their legal obligations, they should not seek to undertake planning enforcement action which would unnecessarily restrict the ability of caravan, campsite and holiday parks to extend their open season.</p>\n</div>"
