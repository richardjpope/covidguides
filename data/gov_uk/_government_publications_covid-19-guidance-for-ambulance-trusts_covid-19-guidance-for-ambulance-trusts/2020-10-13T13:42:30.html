<p>18 May: section 1 - addition of  â€˜ new continuous cough OR a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)â€™ for the possible case definition.</p>

<h2 id="identification-of-possible-cases">
<span class="number">1. </span>Identification of possible cases</h2>

<p>There is currently sustained transmission of COVID-19 throughout the UK so there is an increased likelihood of any patient having coronavirus infection. Therefore, while in this phase all patient contacts require level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879111/T4_poster_Recommended_PPE_additional_considerations_of_COVID-19.pdf" class="govuk-link">in accordance with Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance is for possible and confirmed cases of COVID-19 where an ambulance response is required, including both emergency and non-emergency provision.</p>

<p>COVID-19 infection should be considered in all cases of respiratory infection. A travel history is no longer a requirement for determining a possible case. The following has been left in for information purposes, however due to the sustained community transmission currently occurring in the UK there is an increased likelihood of any patient having coronavirus infection.</p>

<p>If patients meet the below criteria they are to be classified as a possible case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acute respiratory distress syndrome</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>high temperature (of 37.8Â°C or higher)</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>new onset continuous cough</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible or confirmed cases are identified, this information must be passed to the responding resources (ambulance, PTS or response car) prior to arrival on scene.</p>

<h2 id="on-scene-clinician-precautions">
<span class="number">2. </span>On-scene clinician precautions</h2>

<p>This guidance covers the use of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a> for the management and transfer of a patient with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Staff should perform a dynamic risk assessment which should include information provided prior to arrival at scene. Where the risk assessment indicates a requirement for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> crews, they should don the appropriate level before being within 2 metres of the patient.</p>

<p>There is currently sustained transmission of COVID-19 throughout the UK, therefore there is an increased likelihood of any patient having coronavirus infection; Refer to the <a href="#section3PPE" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> section below</a>.</p>

<p>The risk assessment should include information provided prior to arrival at scene as well as any additional information gained on arrival. See <a href="#section3PPE" class="govuk-link">section 3</a> for the appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to be worn.</p>

<p>The patient should be provided with a surgical face mask to wear for the duration of the care (if tolerated) unless oxygen therapy is indicated.</p>

<p>Where possible, only one crew member would need to don <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> if the patient can be managed by a single person, this leaves the driver free to perform the transfer and/or admission without having to remove <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and decontaminate before driving.</p>

<h3 id="aerosol-generating-procedures-agp">
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> generate tiny particles, small enough to remain in the air for extended periods, travel long distances and may be inhaled.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is to be performed, all crew members must don level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before being within 2 metres of the patient.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr></a> is the body which defines aerosol generating procedures. Refer to the <a rel="external" href="https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2893/documents/1_tbp-lr-agp-v1.pdf" class="govuk-link">supporting evidence.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> relevant to the ambulance service, which have been determined as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> by Public Health (England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland) and <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>procedures related to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, for example advanced airway procedures such as laryngoscopy, intubation, extubation and surgical airway</li>
  <li>manual ventilation</li>
  <li>suctioning</li>
  <li>management of choking and foreign body airway obstruction removal</li>
</ul>

<p>Ambulance clinicians may come across the following wider list of <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>, particularly during inter-hospital transfers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracheotomy or tracheostomy procedures (insertion or open suctioning or removal)</li>
  <li>non-invasive ventilation (NIV)</li>
  <li>Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (BiPAP)</li>
  <li>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (CPAP)</li>
  <li>High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV)</li>
  <li>High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are not considered as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest compressions</li>
  <li>defibrillation</li>
  <li>nebulisation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-points">
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Main points</h3>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn by all staff who have direct contact with a possible or confirmed COVID-19 patient and within 2 metres of the patient.</p>

<p>If the vehicle has a closed bulkhead between the patient compartment and cab then <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must <strong>not</strong> be worn while driving or within the vehicle cab.</p>

<p>If there is no closed bulkhead between the patient compartment and cab then it may be necessary to wear a fluid repellent surgical mask if the patient will be within 2 metres of the driver while being conveyed.</p>

<p>Unless absolutely essential, <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> should be avoided during the transportation of patients with COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="section3PPE">
<span class="number">3. </span>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn following a risk assessment of the presenting risks, and staff should not wear a higher level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> than is indicated by their risk assessment and reference to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">national guidance</a> (dependent on the current status of transmission).</p>

<p>Use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as described below should not detract from the usual infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) risk assessments that staff carry out routinely to underpin all clinical practice and decision making. Staff should also ensure the correct level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is worn dependant on the patient presentation and the clinical skills that are required during patient care.</p>

<p>The ambulance sector <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 is categorised by level:</p>

<h4 id="level-1-standard-infection-control-precautions">Level 1: Standard infection control precautions</h4>

<p>Consider if any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required based on risk of contact or splashing with blood or bodily fluids.</p>

<h4 id="level-2">Level 2:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>disposable apron</li>
  <li>fluid repellent surgical mask</li>
  <li>eye protection (if risk of splashing)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="level-3">Level 3:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>fluid repellent coveralls/long sleeved apron/gown</li>
  <li>FFP3* or powered respirator hood</li>
  <li>eye protection</li>
</ul>

<p>*Where an FFP3 mask with a non-shrouded valve is worn, it should be accompanied by a full-face visor.  If a visor is not available, then a risk assessment should be carried out regarding the risk of splash to the valve. If a large splash (as opposed to droplets) does occur, then the FFP3 mask should be replaced immediately.</p>

<p>The required level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is recommended to be used as a minimum for the care of all possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases, can be found in <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879108/T3_poster_Recommended_PPE_for_ambulance_staff_paramedics_transport_pharmacy.pdf" class="govuk-link">Table 3 of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is currently sustained community transmission of COVID-19 throughout the UK, which means that it is likely that any patient may have coronavirus infection and therefore level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is recommended for all direct patient care (within 2m) as per <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879111/T4_poster_Recommended_PPE_additional_considerations_of_COVID-19.pdf" class="govuk-link">Table 4 of the PHE <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance</a></p>

<h3 id="correct-use-of-ppe">
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Correct use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn following the risk assessment of the presenting risks, and staff should not wear a higher level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> than is indicated by their risk assessment.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to ensure that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is donned and doffed correctly to avoid inadvertent contamination.</p>

<p>All used <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be disposed of as category B clinical waste and any reusable items (for example eye protection or powered respirator hoods) must be decontaminated according to manufacturer or Trust instructions.</p>

<p>FFP3 face masks must only be used by staff who have been fit tested for the mask they are using, and staff must complete a fit check every time they are required to wear one.</p>

<p>Powered respirator checks must be performed before each use, in accordance with the trust instructions, including a battery check.</p>

<p>Although FFP3 masks are effective for longer periods, the general recommendation would be to wear the FFP3 face masks for up to 3 hours. However, the duration of wear is dependent on the outcome of a dynamic risk assessment conducted by the staff member taking into consideration a number of factors such as the environment, personal comfort/tolerance and the activity or task that is being undertaken.</p>

<p>Where an FFP3 mask with a non-shrouded valve is worn, these are not fully protected from splash of bodily fluids (they still provide full protection for aerosols) and should be accompanied by a full face shield/ visor. Where this is not available a risk assessment of the risk of splashing should be undertaken; it is not advised to wear a fluid resistant surgical mask over the FFP3 facemask. If a large splash (as opposed to droplets) does occur, then the FFP3 mask should be <strong>replaced immediately</strong>.</p>

<p>Fluid repellent surgical face masks can be worn for the entire patient care episode, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has confirmed that the masks can be worn until damaged or wet</p>

<h3 id="considerations-for-cardiac-arrests">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Considerations for cardiac arrests</h3>

<p>The majority of patients who get COVID-19 will have mild symptoms, and it is estimated about 4% to 5% may be critically ill.</p>

<p>If a patient experiences a witnessed cardiac arrest in front of ambulance responders, commence compression only resuscitation using level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. If there is more than one responder on-scene, those trained in level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should move to be at least 2m from the patient and don level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before proving advanced life support assistance. The full procedure detailed here for any cardiac arrest applies.</p>

<p>In the event of a patient being in cardiac arrest it will not always be possible to determine the potential COVID-19 risk. Therefore, this guidance should be followed for <strong>all</strong> cardiac arrests until further notice.</p>

<h4 id="first-person-attending-scene">First person attending scene</h4>

<p>In order to minimise any delay attending a time critical cardiac arrest, it is acceptable for the first person to enter the scene wearing level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (fluid repellent surgical mask, apron, gloves and eye protection). Where trained and equipped to use level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, this may be used where it will not cause a delay.</p>

<p>Commence resuscitation where this is indicated by local clinical guidance. If resuscitation is not commenced, or is terminated before the arrival of other resources, provide an early sitrep to reduce the number of responders who need to enter the scene.</p>

<p>Do not place your face near the patient to assess breathing.</p>

<p>Where available, place a surgical mask or oxygen mask on the patients face.</p>

<p>Commence chest compressions, attach the defibrillator and defibrillate if indicated. None of these tasks are considered aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Do not progress to airway management or ventilation.</p>

<p>If not already available on-scene, request back up from a level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> trained response.</p>

<h4 id="subsequent-attendance-at-scene-of-responders-trained-and-equipped-to-use-level-3-ppe">Subsequent attendance at scene of responder(s) trained and equipped to use level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Don level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter scene and determine whether the resuscitation should be continued according to local clinical guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If resuscitation is to be continued, take over patient management from any responder wearing level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All responders wearing level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> are to leave the scene (more than 2m away from the patient) prior to the commencement of any airway management, ventilation or other <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. Responders may later re-enter if trained and equipped to wear level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> responders to continue the resuscitation, including airway management and ventilation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone who is not trained or does not have access to level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must then withdraw from the scene.</p>

<h3 id="donning-ppe">
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Donning <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required for all possible or confirmed COVID-19 patients and should be donned in the following order:</p>

<h4 id="level-2-ppe">Level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Disposable apron.</li>
  <li>Fluid repellent surgical mask.</li>
  <li>Eye protection if risk of splashing to the face and eyes.</li>
  <li>Disposable gloves.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="level-3-ppe-ffp3-and-eye-protection">Level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (FFP3 and eye protection)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Fluid repellent coverall.</li>
  <li>FFP3 face mask.</li>
  <li>Eye protection.</li>
  <li>Disposable gloves â€“ double glove if wearing a coverall (this reduces risk of contamination when removing the coverall).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="level-3-ppe-powered-respirator-hood">Level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (powered respirator hood)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Fluid repellent coverall.</li>
  <li>Powered respirator hood.</li>
  <li>Disposable gloves â€“ double glove if wearing a coverall (this reduces risk of contamination when removing the coverall).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="doffing-ppe">
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Doffing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>It is important that the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is removed in an order that minimises the potential for cross-contamination.</p>

<p>When doffing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, follow the order below with the support and observation of your crew mate to ensure the risk of cross-contamination is minimised.</p>

<p>Hand decontamination helps to prevent the spread of infection. Use alcohol hand rub between removing items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and wash your hands, wrists and forearms once all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is removed.</p>

<h4 id="level-2-ppe-1">Level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>

<h2 id="patient-assessment">
<span class="number">4. </span>Patient assessment</h2>

<p>The recommended advice for possible COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms is for them to stay at home until they are well. Refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home advice</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="care-of-the-deceased">
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Care of the deceased</h3>

<p>Those handling bodies should be aware that there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from the body fluids and tissues of cases where COVID-19 is identified. The usual principles of standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission-based precautions (TBPs) apply for bodies that are possible or confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<p>As a minimum, the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for handling a deceased possible or confirmed COVID-19 patient is Level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased" class="govuk-link">guidance for care of the deceased</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conveyance-and-patient-handover">
<span class="number">5. </span>Conveyance and patient handover</h2>

<p>If the patient requires conveyance it is important to contact the receiving unit to have a discussion regarding where to take the patient as this may not be the usual area within the hospital.</p>

<p>If possible COVID-19 patients require conveyance, they must be conveyed in isolation and are not permitted to be cohorted, unless they are members of the same household.</p>

<p>If required, confirmed COVID-19 patients may be cohorted with other confirmed patients (numbers dependant on vehicle size and limitations).</p>

<p>If community screening is available within the area, then follow the local protocol.</p>

<p>If the patient requires conveyance they will require conveying to, and assessment at, an infectious disease unit (<abbr title="Infectious Disease Units">IDU</abbr>) or emergency department (<abbr title="Emergency Department">ED</abbr>), as per local agreements, and with an appropriate pre-alert and discussion before leaving the scene.</p>

<p>If conveyance of a cardiac arrest patient is indicated by local clinical guidance, once <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are being conducted, only staff wearing level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be within 2 metres of the patient. In practice, this means that all responders in the patient compartment of the ambulance must be in level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. The ambulance may be driven by someone who is not trained/equipped to use level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, but they must remain in the cab whilst the patient is unloaded.</p>

<h3 id="utilising-the-most-appropriate-conveying-resource">
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Utilising the most appropriate conveying resource</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Possible cases must not be conveyed by rapid response vehicle.</p>

<p>For vehicles where there is no closed bulkhead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the patient is over 2 metres away from the driver there is no requirement for the driver to wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during conveyance</li>
  <li>the patient must, wherever possible, wear a surgical mask during transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>The following guidance applies whenever a patient is conveyed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consider the removal of non-essential equipment from the vehicle or moving non-essential equipment to a closed compartment prior to loading the patient in the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Avoid opening cupboards and compartments unless essential, if equipment is likely to be required then remove from the cupboard prior to loading patient.</li>
  <li>Consider if alternative transport options are available in liaison with Ambulance Control Room (<abbr title="Ambulance Control Room">ACR</abbr>).</li>
  <li>Air conditioning or ventilation on vehicles must be set to extract and not recirculate the air within the vehicle (where possible).</li>
  <li>Non-essential persons (such as observers, family members) are not to travel within the patient compartment with a possible or confirmed case, unless the patient is a child who requires conveyance, in this case it is acceptable for a parent or guardian to accompany the child.</li>
  <li>Family members and relatives of these patients must be asked to remain at home and not attend the hospital. They should be left with contact details for the hospital you are conveying the patient to and asked to phone later for an update before visiting.</li>
  <li>Observers should, where possible, be taken to the nearest ambulance station. If this is not possible, they should remain in the cab of the vehicle for the duration of the incident and the <abbr title="Ambulance Control Room">ACR</abbr> should be notified.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="pre-alert">Pre-alert</h4>

<p>Crews are required to notify the receiving unit to the fact that they are conveying a possible or confirmed COVID-19 patient and provide an expected time of arrival (ETA) to ensure the receiving unit can prepare for arrival and patient isolation. The receiving unit will advise the crew where the patient should be brought, as it may not be the <abbr title="Emergency Department">ED</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="on-arrival">On arrival</h4>

<p>The driver is to inform the receiving unit of their arrival prior to off-loading the patient.</p>

<p>The receiving unit is required to support the offloading of the patient into the department, ensuring the route is clear.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for ambulance clinicians to change or upgrade their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for the purposes of entering the <abbr title="Emergency Department">ED</abbr>, or the receiving unit, to conduct patient handover.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-aviation-for-transfer-of-covid-19-patients">
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Use of aviation for transfer of COVID-19 patients</h3>

<p>There are circumstances where it is appropriate for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients to be flown, for example during transfer by air ambulance. Organisations responsible for these operations should evaluate options and take measures to minimise risk of transmission from contact, droplet and airborne routes to attending medical staff and to aircrew.</p>

<p>On occasions, <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> will be necessary during the airborne transfer of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients (for example, in emergency airway suction).  Despite measures being taken to avoid <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> being routinely delivered on the aircraft, planning must be made for this eventuality.</p>

<p>Organisations should consider whether the cockpit can be isolated from the medical cabin sufficiently to prevent contact, droplet and airborne transmission, for example using an â€˜air-tightâ€™ bulkhead seal and separating cabin and cockpit ventilation systems<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">1</a></sup>.  Where this can be achieved, the aircraft may be considered in a similar way to a land ambulance with a closed bulkhead between attending medical personnel and ambulance driver. In such circumstances, the same advice in terms of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and subsequent disinfection should be followed.</p>

<p>If the cockpit and medical cabin cannot be separated, organisations must consider whether other measures to avoid transmission are feasible. This includes contact and droplet avoidance, maintaining a distance from pilot(s) to the patient of &gt;2 metres or appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> against these modes of transmission (which may or may not be practicable). Additionally, for the avoidance of airborne transmission, fit-tested FFP3 respiratory protection would need to be donned before any <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>. As donning <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> quickly in flight may be impossible for pilots, they may have to wear FFP3 throughout a patient transfer flight. Trials have shown this is feasible but individual organisations may have to determine if these measures are operationally acceptable.</p>

<p>Some organisations may consider the use of â€˜isolation podsâ€™ with appropriate air filtration where cabin separation is not possible. Careful assessment must be made to the practicality of emergency management of patients in such â€˜podsâ€™ and whether an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> can be delivered safely without breaking the seal of the device. If not, other precautions must be in place as above.</p>

<p>Organisations should also consider ACH<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">2</a></sup>  with respect to the medical cabin to determine post-<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> procedure for their particular aircraft type<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Following the carriage of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient it is recommended that both aircraft cabin and equipment are decontaminated. This should be done with disinfectants approved for use on the aircraft type and equipment concerned.</p>

<h2 id="post-conveyance">
<span class="number">6. </span>Post conveyance</h2>

<p>All linen should be managed as per local policy for the management of infectious linen at the receiving unit.</p>

<p>All waste should be disposed of as category B clinical waste, as per local policy, at the receiving unit.</p>

<p>The crew are to remove <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the designated area identified within the receiving unit.</p>

<p>All disposable <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is to be disposed of as category B clinical waste, as per local policy, at the receiving unit.</p>

<h2 id="decontamination">
<span class="number">7. </span>Decontamination</h2>

<p>As coronaviruses have a lipid envelope, a wide range of disinfectants are effective. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and good infection prevention and control precautions are effective at minimising risk but can never eliminate it.</p>

<p>If an alternative disinfectant is used within the organisation, the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (<abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control Team">IPCT</abbr>) should be consulted on this to ensure that this is effective against enveloped viruses.</p>

<p>It is possible that these viruses can survive in the environment with the amount of virus contamination on surfaces likely to have decreased significantly by 72 hours, so thorough environmental decontamination is vital.</p>

<p>Where equipment is used on-scene for assessing/ treating patients, which are not conveyed the equipment can be decontaminated using universal sanitising wipes or equivalent approved disinfectant.</p>

<h3 id="any-vehicle-when-no-agp-procedures-have-been-performed">
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Any vehicle when no <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> procedures have been performed</h3>

<p>The vehicle will require an enhanced between patient clean, ensuring thorough decontamination of all exposed surfaces, equipment and contact areas before it is returned to normal operational duties, with universal sanitising wipes or a chlorine-based product.</p>

<p>Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn to decontaminate the vehicle â€“ as a minimum, this should include apron and gloves.</p>

<p>Any exposed equipment (that is not within closed compartments) including stretcher on the vehicle will require decontamination with universal sanitising wipes or equivalent, as per the standard between patient clean.</p>

<p>All contact surfaces (cupboards, walls, ledges), working from top to bottom in a systematic process, will require decontamination.</p>

<p>Pay special attention to all touch points.</p>

<p>The vehicle floor should be decontaminated with a detergent solution. This should be at a minimum of the end of every shift and more frequently where facilities exist. Where possible, hospitals should support this practice by working with ambulance colleagues to identify access to appropriate sluice facilities and designated mop and bucket storage for ambulance use.</p>

<p>Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn to decontaminate the vehicle â€“ as a minimum, this should include apron and gloves (follow COSHH guidance for protective equipment when using chlorine).</p>

<p>Any exposed equipment (that is not within closed compartments) left on the vehicle will require decontamination with a universal detergent followed by chlorine-based solution at 1,000 parts per million (or approved equivalent disinfectant).</p>

<p>Working from top to bottom in a systematic process, all exposed surfaces will require decontamination with a universal detergent followed by a chlorine-based solution at 1,000 parts per million (or approved equivalent).</p>

<p>Pay special attention to all touch points.</p>

<p>Ensure that the stretcher is fully decontaminated, including the underneath and the base.</p>

<p>The vehicle floor should be decontaminated with a detergent solution followed by a chlorine-based solution at 1,000 parts per million (or approved equivalent), this should be facilitated by the receiving department. Where possible hospitals should support this practice by working with ambulance colleagues to identify access to appropriate sluice facilities and designated mop and bucket storage for ambulance use.</p>

If resuscitation is not commenced, or is terminated before the arrival of other resources, provide an early sitrep to reduce the number of responders who need to enter the scene.</p><p>Do not place your face near the patient to assess breathing.</p><p>Where available, place a surgical mask or oxygen mask on the patients face.</p><p>Commence chest compressions, attach the defibrillator and defibrillate if indicated.

Despite measures being taken to avoid <abbr title=\"aerosol generating procedures\">AGPs</abbr> being routinely delivered on the aircraft, planning must be made for this eventuality.</p><p>Organisations should consider whether the cockpit can be isolated from the medical cabin sufficiently to prevent contact, droplet and airborne transmission, for example using an â€˜air-tightâ€™ bulkhead seal and separating cabin and cockpit ventilation systems<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"govuk-link\">1</a></sup>.  Where this can be achieved, the aircraft may be considered in a similar way to a land ambulance with a closed bulkhead between attending medical personnel and ambulance driver. In such circumstances, the same advice in terms of <abbr title=\"personal protective equipment\">PPE</abbr> and subsequent disinfection should be followed.</p><p>If the cockpit and medical cabin cannot be separated, organisations must consider whether other measures to avoid transmission are feasible. This includes contact and droplet avoidance, maintaining a distance from pilot(s) to the patient of &gt;2 metres or appropriate <abbr title=\"personal protective equipment\">PPE</abbr> against these modes of transmission (which may or may not be practicable). Additionally, for the avoidance of airborne transmission, fit-tested FFP3 respiratory protection would need to be donned before any <abbr title=\"aerosol generating procedure\">AGP</abbr>. As donning <abbr title=\"personal protective equipment\">PPE</abbr> quickly in flight may be impossible for pilots, they may have to wear FFP3 throughout a patient transfer flight. Trials have shown this is feasible but individual organisations may have to determine if these measures are operationally acceptable.</p><p>Some organisations may consider the use of â€˜isolation podsâ€™ with appropriate air filtration where cabin separation is not possible. Careful assessment must be made to the practicality of emergency management of patients in such â€˜podsâ€™ and whether an <abbr title=\"aerosol generating procedure\">AGP</abbr> can be delivered safely without breaking the seal of the device. If not, other precautions must be in place as above.</p><p>Organisations should also consider ACH<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"govuk-link\">2</a></sup>  with respect to the medical cabin to determine post-<abbr title=\"aerosol generating procedure\">AGP</abbr> procedure for their particular aircraft type<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"govuk-link\">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Following the carriage of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient it is recommended that both aircraft cabin and equipment are decontaminated.
