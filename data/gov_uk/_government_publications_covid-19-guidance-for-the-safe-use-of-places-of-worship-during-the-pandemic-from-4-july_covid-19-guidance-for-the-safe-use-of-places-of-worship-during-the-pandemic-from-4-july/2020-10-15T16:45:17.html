<h2 id="introduction">
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 are outlined by Public Health England. The transmission of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces. The predominant modes of transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.</p>

<p>This guidance for places of worship has been drafted on the basis of the scientific evidence available and will be updated as necessary as more data becomes available on this virus.</p>

<p>Places of worship play an important role in providing spiritual leadership for many individuals, and in bringing communities and generations together. However, their communal nature also makes them places that are particularly vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Through its Places of Worship Taskforce, the government has worked with faith leaders and representatives to develop this guidance to enable the safe reopening of places of worship.</p>

<p>This guidance is applicable in England alongside the relevant associated changes to the law.</p>

<p>This guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation.</p>

<p>On 12 October the government introduced a system of local COVID alert levels. If you live, work or volunteer in an area that is part of local COVID alert level: high or local COVID alert level: very high, there are additional restrictions which apply to you.</p>

<p>In general, these additional restrictions do not have significant implications for Places of Worship. Where they do, they have been included in this guidance.</p>

<p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – medium restrictions, when meeting friends and family you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with) you must not meet in a group of more than 6, indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – high” restrictions, you must not mix outside of your household or support bubble indoors, including within a place of worship.</p>

<p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – very high” restrictions, you must not mix outside of your household or support bubble indoors, including within a place of worship, or outdoors.</p>

<p>Please visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">local COVID alert levels page</a> to find out what level your area is in and the additional restrictions that apply.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-other-people-in-places-of-worship">Meeting other people in places of worship</h3>

<p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – medium restrictions, when meeting friends and family you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with) you must not meet in a group of more than 6, indoors or outdoors. This includes places of worship.</p>

<p>At high and very high levels, you must not meet with friends and family indoors in any setting, including a place of worship, unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You must also not meet with people outside of your household or support bubble in a private garden or in most outdoor public venues.</p>

<p>This is against the law and the police will have the powers to enforce these legal limits, including to issue fines (fixed penalty notices) of £200, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £6,400.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">meeting with others safely (social distancing) guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst engaging in an activity in the place of worship or surrounding grounds, all parties should adhere to social distancing guidelines at all times, even within a group of six or where a specific activity-based exemption is applicable. This means people should be 2 metres apart or more than 1 metre apart as well as taking extra steps to stay safe (such as wearing face coverings) to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<h3 id="summarising-the-position-for-places-of-worship">Summarising the position for places of worship</h3>

<p>The following list sets out where the number of people must be limited within a place of worship due to the potential for increased spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Communal worship, including prayers, devotions or meditations led by a Minister of Religion or lay person</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Limits for communal worship should be decided on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk (see Section 5 ‘Restrictions on Capacity’).</p>

<p>People must follow the restrictions on social mixing set out by their area’s COVID Local Alert Level and adhere to social distancing between households.</p>

<p>In local ‘COVID alert level - medium’ areas people must not mingle in a group of more than 6 (other than with those they live with or have formed a support bubble with).</p>

<p>In ‘local COVID alert level: high’ or ‘very high’, people must not mingle with anyone they do not live with or have formed a support bubble with.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Marriage ceremonies</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Marriages, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies must have no more than 15 people. Anyone working is not included as part of the  limit on those attending.
         .                            <br>
Please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships" class="govuk-link">guidance for small marriages and civil partnerships</a> during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>Attendees should socially distance from anyone they do not live with (unless they are in their support bubble).</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Funerals</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Must have no more than 30 people. Anyone working is not included as part of the 30 person limit.</p>

<p>Please refer to the COVID-19: guidance for managing a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Attendees should socially distance from anyone they do not live with (unless they are in their support bubble).</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Commemorative events</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>These are events which occur to commemorate or mark the deceased’s passing. Examples include a wake, a stone setting ceremony or the scattering of ashes.</p>

<p>Such events must have no more than 15 people in attendance, excluding those who are present for work purposes.</p>

<p>Such gatherings cannot take place in a private dwelling or garden.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Significant life events (outside of marriage ceremonies and funerals)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Where such events are an element of communal worship, they are subject to the requirements for communal worship set out above.</p>

<p>Otherwise, such events are subject to wider rules around social mixing dependent on an area’s COVID local alert level.</p>

<p>This means that, in a COVID-19 secure venue or public outdoor place, there can be more than 6 people in total present from multiple households. In ‘local COVID alert level: medium’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of 6. In ‘local COVID alert levels high’ and ‘very high’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of the same household or support bubble.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Supervised children’s activities</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Limited to the number of people who can safely social distance in the venue in line with COVID-19 Secure guidance. See guidance for providers of out-of-school settings.</p>

<p>This includes, but is not limited to, activities such as mother and baby groups with multiple adults supervising children. In these situations, adults should maintain social distancing with other adults from different households.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Support groups</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Support groups can take place with up to a maximum of 15 people in a public place, if the support group is organised by a business, a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support to its members or those who attend its meetings.</p>

<p>This includes, but is not limited to, providing support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to victims of crime (including domestic abuse)</li>
  <li>to those with, or recovering from, addictions (including alcohol, narcotics or other substance addictions) or addictive patterns of behaviour</li>
  <li>to new and expectant parents</li>
  <li>to those with, or caring for persons with, any long-term illness, disability or terminal condition or who are vulnerable</li>
  <li>to those facing issues related to their sexuality or identity including those living as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender</li>
  <li>to those who have suffered bereavement</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an exemption to the legal gatherings limits at all alert levels.</p>

<p>Support groups not covered by this exemption can still take place if they do not breach the new gatherings limits at each alert level.  This means that for these other groups, in a COVID-19 Secure venue or public outdoor place, there can be more than 6 people in total present from multiple households. In ‘local COVID alert level - medium’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of 6. In ‘local COVID alert levels - high’ and ‘very high’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of the same household or support bubble.</p>

<p>Where this is unlikely to be possible, groups should not take place. Anybody who is working in facilitating the group or attending for work purposes is not included.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Small prayer and study groups</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p>

<p>Limits for prayer and study groups should be decided on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk (see Section 5 ‘Restrictions on Capacity</p>

<p>In ‘local COVID alert level - medium’ areas, People people must not mingle in a group of more than 6 (other than with those they live with or have formed a support bubble with).</p>

<p>In ‘local COVID alert level: high’ or ‘very high’ areas, people must not mingle in groups with anyone they do not live with or have formed a support bubble with.</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-this-guidance">
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance is designed to assist places of worship in England to open for a broad range of worship activities, in accordance with the associated legislation. The guidance sets out how this can be done in a manner that is COVID-19 secure and in line with social distancing guidelines, in order to minimise the risk of exposure to infection.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-for-the-purposes-of-this-guidance">Definitions for the purposes of this guidance</h3>

<p><strong>“Place of worship”</strong></p>

<p>A place of worship refers to a building used for regular religious ceremonies, communal worship or similar gatherings by religious organisations. It includes the use of surrounding grounds, for example, adjoining carparks, courtyards or gardens for which the venue managers are also responsible.</p>

<p>The guidance also covers premises when being used for religious gatherings, even when their primary purpose is not for religious gatherings, such as a community centre. These premises will only be able to be used where they are permitted to be open and additional guidance may be applicable.</p>

<p>This guidance does not cover public parks, private homes, cultural sites or other open spaces, such as woodlands which may be used for religious purposes. If people do want to engage in worship in these spaces, then the guidance relevant to that place should be adhered to.</p>

<p><strong>“Significant life cycle events”</strong></p>

<p>Events to mark or celebrate a significant milestone in a person’s life, according to their religion or belief, such as events to celebrate a person’s birth (other than a birthday) or coming of age. Examples would include a christening, or a naming ceremony. They do not include ‘celebrations’ or parties to mark these events.</p>

<p><strong>“Worshippers” or “Visitors”</strong></p>

<p>Those entering the place of worship to engage in worship or other activity for which the place of worship may be used.</p>

<p><strong>“Venue managers”</strong></p>

<p>The person or persons responsible for the management of an individual place of worship, including assessment of compliance with the following guidelines and relevant law. This may be a religious leader or lay person.</p>

<p><strong>“Household” and “Support Bubble”</strong></p>

<p>A household is a person or a group of people who live together in the same accommodation.</p>

<p>A support bubble is where a single adult living alone, or a single parent with children under 18, can form an exclusive network with one other household where social distancing does not have to be observed.</p>

<p>The 2 households that form a support bubble count as one household for the purposes of this guidance.</p>

<p><strong>“Must”</strong></p>

<p>Where the guidance states that an activity must take place this is because it is a requirement under:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/986/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1103/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Medium) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1104/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>

</ul>

<p>and therefore is a requirement in law.</p>

<p><strong>“Should”</strong></p>

<p>Where the guidance states that an activity must take place this is because it is a requirement under:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/986/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1104/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>

</ul>

<p>however it is strongly advised that consideration is given to following the advice being given to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="section3">
<span class="number">3. </span> Key principles for safely opening places of worship</h2>

<p>Each individual place of worship is strongly advised to apply this guidance with reference to its own specific circumstances, including its size and type of activities, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>Venue managers of places of worship will have discretion over when they consider it safe to open and should decide to remain closed if they are not able to safely adhere to the guidelines outlined below.</p>

<p>Venue managers should take all possible steps to secure the safety of the public, ensuring that gathering limits, including those set in COVID local alert levels, are adhered to. While places of worship will not be mandated to implement any further restrictions that a local authority may suggest to control the spread of the virus within the local alert levels Individual venues should work with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and apply any additional actions to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to  seat a number of people inside a venue safely, it may not be safe for them all to travel to and from, or enter and exit, the venue</li>
  <li>staggering entry times with other local venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas</li>
  <li>arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues - advising visitors to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue</li>
  <li>visitors will be responsible for not gathering in groups larger than 6 on their way to and from places of worship</li>
</ul>

<p>Many places of worship are also workplaces and should therefore be aware of their responsibilities as employers under existing health and safety law. Places of worship also have a duty of care to volunteers, to ensure that as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to how fair and equal access can safely be provided for all users to be able to undertake faith practices within a place of worship, in line with government guidelines and considering requirements under the Equality Act 2010 where these apply.</p>

<p>To help decide which actions to take, we advise that a COVID-19 risk assessment is completed by each place of worship and for some events or gatherings this will be required by law. This may be done in addition to any risk assessment already in place or as a separate assessment.</p>

<p>When a building or space is being repurposed as a place of worship i.e. you are using a building or space which you have not used previously for this purpose, a new fire risk assessment must take place.</p>

<p>This link provides <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm" class="govuk-link">generic guidance on completing a risk assessment</a>. Assessments should be done in consultation with unions or workers (including volunteers and contractors) if relevant. It may also be beneficial to discuss the risk assessment with worshippers or other stakeholders (such as neighbouring tenants or property owners) to assist understanding among faith communities and local communities and improve reopening design and execution.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment that accounts for COVID-19 could constitute a breach of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1103/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Medium) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1104/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1105/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Very High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Having a risk assessment with insufficient measures set out could also constitute a breach of the above legislation. Places of worship are encouraged to make their risk assessments available online where possible.</p>

<p>Venue managers are strongly advised to take action to minimise the potential for spreading of COVID-19 among worshippers, and those working or volunteering within the building and surrounding grounds. You may want to engage worshippers in co-designing an informal community behaviour agreement.</p>

<h2 id="section4">
<span class="number">4. </span> Adapting practices to reduce the spread of infection</h2>

<p>Religious leaders should adopt the guidance below and seek to include additional changes that could be made to their religious rituals that usually involve close contact and shared items between individuals.</p>

<p>Places of worship and faith communities should adapt religious services, especially where ceremonies would otherwise have taken place over a number of hours or days, to ensure the safety of those present and minimise spread of infection. It is advised that the ceremonies and services should be concluded in the shortest reasonable time.</p>

<p>Once completed, participants should be encouraged to move on promptly, to minimise the risk of contact and spread of infection. If appropriate, you should reconfigure spaces to enable worshippers to be seated rather than standing which reduces the risk of contact.</p>

<p>Worshippers should limit their interactions dependent on their area’s COVID local alert level. At the medium level they should interact only with the group of 6 they entered the place of worship with. At the high and very high levels, additional restrictions apply and worshippers must not mix outside of their households. These restrictions still apply for significant life cycle events, but do not apply to weddings or funerals.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, where possible, places of worship continue to stream worship or other events to avoid large gatherings and to continue to reach those individuals who are self-isolating or particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>

<p>More specific guidance is as follows.</p>

<h3 id="the-use-of-shared-items">The use of shared items</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Individuals should be prevented from touching or kissing objects that are handled communally. Barriers and/or clear signage should be put in place where necessary to avoid this taking place.</li>
  <li>Individuals should also avoid touching property belonging to others such as shoes which, if removed, should be placed and collected by their owner while adhering to social distancing principles.</li>
  <li>Reusable and communal resources such as prayer mats, service sheets, religious texts or devotional material should be removed from use. Single use alternatives should be provided as long as they are removed and disposed of by the worshipper.</li>
  <li>Items owned by the individual to aid worship such as a prayer mat or religious text, can be brought in but should be removed again by the worshipper.</li>
  <li>In circumstances where worshippers cannot bring their own books, places of worship should keep a selection of clean books for individuals to use. Clean books should be quarantined for 48 hours since their previous use and should be quarantined for 48 hours again after use. Items which cannot be easily cleaned should also be subject to the 48 hour quarantine after use.</li>
  <li>Please also refer to specific cleaning advice below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="food-and-drink">Food and drink</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where food or drink (‘consumables’) are essential to the act of worship, they can be used, however the sharing of food should be avoided, as should the use of communal vessels.</li>
  <li>If it is necessary to handle consumables as a part of a faith practice, those giving and receiving food items should wash their hands thoroughly before and after consumption, or wear gloves.</li>
  <li>The person distributing the consumable should release it, into the hand only, in such a way to avoid any contact between them and those receiving it, or wear gloves. If accidental contact does occur, both people should cleanse their hands immediately.</li>
  <li>Other actions taken to reduce the risk of transmission should also be considered, for example, foodstuffs should be prewrapped, and a system should be in place to prevent individuals from coming into contact with consumables and any dishes and/ or cutlery other than their own (for example the use of shared bowls).</li>
  <li>Speaking, singing and chanting should not happen across uncovered consumables (other than consumables to be used by the celebrant alone). Instead consumables should be securely covered, and prior to the receptacle being opened, it should be cleaned, hands should be washed or gloves worn.</li>
  <li>Hospitality spaces within a place of worship, such as cafes, are permitted to open but should be limited to table-service, social distancing should be observed, and with minimal staff and customer contact in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery" class="govuk-link">hospitality guidance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="singing-chanting-and-the-use-of-musical-instruments">Singing, chanting and the use of musical instruments</h3>

<p>What the leader(s) and performers can and cannot do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For performance during worship (and rehearsals), both indoors and outdoors those performing in:
    <ul>
      <li>a professional capacity; and</li>
      <li>those under 18 where supervised, 
<br>are not limited in number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In all other cases, where the number of adult performers will be greater than 6, each group of up to 6 performers should ensure that they do not mix and that appropriate social distancing requirements are observed.</li>
  <li>Singing should be limited to the performers, and worship should not include congregational singing.</li>
  <li>Places of worship should take account of the Performing Arts guidance which outlines additional mitigations such as good ventilation.</li>
  <li>Where music plays a big part in worship, and recordings are available, we suggest you consider using these as an alternative to live singing to mitigate risks.</li>
  <li>Any instrument played during worship should be cleaned thoroughly before and after use.</li>
  <li>Avoid playing music at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult or that may encourage shouting when people will be trying to converse before or after worship.</li>
</ul>

<p>What the congregation can and cannot do</p>

<ul>
  <li>People should avoid singing, shouting and raising voices. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.</li>
  <li>Activities such as singing, chanting, shouting and/or playing of instruments that are blown into should be specifically avoided by congregations/worshippers. This is because there is a possible additional risk of transmission in environments where individuals are singing or chanting as a group, and this applies even if social distancing is being observed or face coverings are used.</li>
  <li>Therefore, spoken responses during worship should also not be in a raised voice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weddings-funerals-and-commemorative-events">Weddings, funerals and commemorative events</h3>

<p>It is strongly advised that only essential aspects of the ceremonies take place at this time.</p>

<h3 id="weddings">Weddings</h3>

<p>Weddings can continue to take place with up to 15 people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No food or drink should be consumed as a part of the event unless required for the purposes of solemnisation.</li>
  <li>Those attending should socially distance from anyone they do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with).</li>
  <li>Wedding receptions can take place in areas that are subject to medium or high COVID local alert levels, with up to 15 people in the form of a sit down meal. They must not take place in areas subject to very high local alert level restrictions.</li>

  <li>Events which occur to commemorate or mark the deceased’s passing, such as a wake, stone setting ceremony or the scattering of ashes, can take place with up to 15 people at all COVID local alert levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outdoor-worship">Outdoor worship</h3>

<h4 id="in-the-grounds-of-a-place-of-worship">In the grounds of a place of worship</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The law allows for multiple groups to pray in a place of worship or its grounds.</li>
  <li>In medium COVID local alert level areas, the law allows for multiple groups of six people to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle.</li>
  <li>In high or very high level areas, the law allows for multiple groups of different households and support bubbles to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle.</li>
  <li>A risk assessment must be conducted and COVID-19 secure measures implemented. The number of people who are able to gather will therefore be dependent on the size of the space available.</li>
  <li>A risk assessment should also consider the security of worshippers. This may require involving local partners such as the police.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="public-outdoor-spaces">Public outdoor spaces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>For acts of worship taking place away from the place of worship and surrounding grounds please follow the relevant guidance on the number of people permitted to gather in those spaces.</li>
  <li>If anyone is considering arranging an event for more than 6 people in a public outdoor space they should liaise with those responsible for the open space in question to ensure that the event can be staged in a safe and legal way, which includes undertaking a risk assessment that considers security (see Annex A).</li>
  <li>Talk to your local authority about any large events you want to hold – you should be aware that some local authorities have powers under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 to impose restrictions on events or on public outdoor spaces by direction, if certain criteria are met.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-of-water">Use of water</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Any pre-requisite washing/ablution rituals should not be done at the place of worship but carried out prior to arrival.</li>
  <li>In rare circumstances where it is necessary, washing facilities within the place of worship should be used in line with social distancing guidelines and hygiene measures applied.</li>
  <li>People should not wash the body parts of others.</li>
  <li>Where rituals or ceremonies require water to be applied to the body others present should move out of range of any potential splashing.</li>
  <li>Where an infant is involved a parent/guardian or other member of the infant’s regular household should hold the infant.</li>
  <li>All individuals involved should thoroughly wash their hands before and after and ensure good hygiene.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-immersion">Full immersion</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where full immersion in water is necessary as part of a ritual or ceremony, this should be very carefully planned following the rules below.</li>
  <li>Those being immersed should be at least 2 metres away from the congregation and officiants at all times, except while they are being immersed.</li>
  <li>Only one person should be immersed at any time and they should only be attended by a single officiant/clergy member.</li>
  <li>During the immersion, clergy/the officiant can place their hands on the head of the person being immersed, but they should not ‘cradle’ the person or touch them in any other way</li>
  <li>Clergy/the officiant should wash their hands after each person is immersed, or if this isn’t possible they should use hand sanitiser.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cash-donations">Cash donations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where possible faith leaders should discourage cash donations and continue to use online or contactless giving and resources.</li>
  <li>Where this is not an option, cash should be collected in a receptacle that is set in one place and handled by one individual, as opposed to being passed around. Regular cleaning and hygiene should be maintained, and gloves worn to handle cash offerings where giving continues.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="young-people-and-children-attending-places-of-worship">Young people and children attending places of worship</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Organised children’s activities can take place within a place of worship, and are limited to the number of people who can safely social distance in the venue in line with COVID-19 secure guidance. These can include, but not limited to activities such as mother and baby groups, youth groups and classes.</li>
  <li>Specific guidance for out-of-school settings has been published and should be followed when providing tuition, training, instruction or activities outside normal school hours (such as evenings, weekends, school holidays). This includes advice to keep children in consistent groups of 15.</li>
  <li>Some running youth groups will also want to refer to the <a rel="external" href="https://nya.org.uk/guidance/" class="govuk-link">National Youth Agency guidance</a> which also recommends groups of 15, and discusses the use of face coverings for over 11s.</li>
  <li>Where adults are supervising young children, they should maintain social distancing from adults from other households.</li>
  <li>For formal childcare and educational settings refer to the relevant guidance.</li>
  <li>Young children should be supervised by the parent or guardian outside of organised children’s activities. They should wash hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly or use hand sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.</li>
  <li>Places of worship can help remind children and young people, and their parents and guardians, of the important actions they should take during the COVID-19 outbreak to help prevent the spread of the virus. Posters on general hand hygiene can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools" class="govuk-link">eBug website</a>.</li>
  <li>Any shared facilities for children, such as play corners, soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean, should be removed and/or put out of use.</li>
  <li>Outdoor playgrounds are permitted to open where venue managers risk assess that it is safe to do so, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>. Particular attention should be paid to cleaning frequently touched surfaces by children and those that are at child height.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section5">
<span class="number">5. </span> General actions to reduce the spread of infection</h2>

<p>People should act in a safe and responsible way in order to reduce the spread of infection in our communities.</p>

<h3 id="test-and-trace">Test and trace</h3>

<p>The government has launched an NHS Test and Trace service to manage the risk of the virus re-emerging. The service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides testing for anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus to find out if they have the virus</li>
  <li>gets in touch with anyone who has had a positive test result to help them share information about any close recent contacts they have had</li>
  <li>alerts those contacts, where necessary, and notifies them they need to self-isolate to help stop the spread of the virus</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information can be found online including for contacts of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person and for places of work.</p>

<p>Venues should assist this service by keeping a temporary record of visitors for 21 days, in a way that is manageable for your place of worship, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed for contact tracing and the investigation of local outbreaks. You should also display official NHS QR code posters so that those with the app can scan in if they choose.</p>

<p>Find further information on maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>When collecting the names and contact details of people attending your place of worship, you should ask for their consent. This is because of the potentially sensitive nature of the data collected in these circumstances, which is protected by law. Guidance on collecting visitor details for Test and Trace, including issues around consent, is provided by the Information Commissioner’s Office. You should make clear that giving contact details is optional and is not a condition of attending your place of worship. We have created a template form for collecting consent at places of worship, available in Annex B.</p>

<h3 id="face-coverings">Face coverings</h3>

<p>In England, face coverings are currently required by law to be worn in places of worship.</p>

<p>There are valid exemptions for some individuals and groups to not wear a face covering in these settings. In particular, those who are leading services or events in a place of worship, and those who assist them (for instance by reading, preaching, or leading prayer) do not always need to wear a face covering, although one should be worn especially if physical distancing cannot be maintained (i.e. distributing consumables) This exemption does not apply to worshippers, who should wear face coverings consistent with the requirements for any other public space.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on the wearing of face coverings at a place of work</a>. For more information please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions-on-capacity">Restrictions on capacity</h3>

<p>Limits for communal worship should be decided locally on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk. The number of people permitted to enter the place of worship at any one time should be limited, should maintain social distancing between households or support bubbles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The size and circumstance (including ventilation) of the premises will determine the maximum number of people that can be accommodated whilst also facilitating social distancing; this may therefore be lower than the maximum 30 people who can attend a funeral, or the 15 who may attend a wedding.</li>
  <li>The safe number of people should be decided by the venue manager.</li>
  <li>In defining the number of people that can reasonably follow social distancing, the total floorspace as well as likely pinch points and busy areas should be taken into account (such as entrances, exits) and where possible alternative or one-way routes introduced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-distancing">Social distancing</h3>

<p>Social distancing measures are actions to reduce social interaction between people in order to minimise the opportunity for transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>All managers and all visitors to a place of worship  must  follow the law and should follow the guidance on social distancing including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adhering to social distancing, meaning people should be 2 metres apart or more than 1 metre apart as well as taking extra steps to stay safe (such as wearing face coverings) to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>For frequently used places, mark areas using floor tape or paint to help people maintain social distance.</li>
  <li>Ensure that groups attending communal worship together do not exceed more than 6 people per group. In medium local alert level areas, the law allows for multiple groups of 6 people to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle. Any group of 6 can be made up of people from different households. In high or very high level areas, the law allows for multiple households and support bubbles to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle. Strict social distancing must be maintained between members of different households at all times.</li>
  <li>The only exception to this where a single household or support bubble is larger than 6 people. In this case, the single household or support bubble may attend communal worship together.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider and set out the additional actions you will take to reduce the risk of transmission in your risk assessment. These could include, for instance, avoiding any face-to-face seating by changing layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, and closing non-essential social spaces, as outlined throughout this guidance.</p>

<p>Queue management is important so the flow of groups in and out of the premises can be carefully controlled in a socially distanced way, reducing the risk of congestion or contact. Considerations should be made for how to manage those waiting outside a place of worship, including the introduction of socially distanced queuing systems.</p>

<p>All religious practices should be carried out to try ensure social distancing can be maintained between individuals from different households. This is to reduce the risk of transmission. There should only be a closer distance when absolutely essential to enable a faith practice to be carried out (for example contact with the faith leader). Time spent in contact should be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>

<p>Other actions to take to reduce the risk of transmission to support social distancing could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Those leading the worship reminding congregants of the importance of social distancing and hygiene.</li>
  <li>Introducing a one-way flow in and out of the premises with appropriate floor markings or signage, with restrictions on accessing non-essential areas. At the end of worship, this could include worshippers leaving one row at a time, in order to prevent crowding at entry or exit points.</li>
  <li>Multiple entry points could be opened, and clear signposting or assistance could be offered to guide worshippers and to avoid congestion.</li>
  <li>Staggering arrival and departure times will reduce the flow at exits and entrances as well as reduce any impacts on public transport. Venues could also consider introducing a booking system to help facilitate this. You may want to consider how prioritisation could be given to people who may have a specific need or requirement.</li>
  <li>Using screens, barriers or alternative rooms and spaces to separate worshippers.</li>
  <li>Any changes to entrances, exits and queues should take into account reasonable adjustments to accommodate those who need them, such as worshippers with physical disabilities.</li>
  <li>Introducing a booking system to help with managing numbers, particularly for services where demand will be high.</li>
  <li>Venue managers advertising set days or times when places of worship are open solely for those particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, such as those over 70 or clinically vulnerable.</li>
  <li>Leading worship in different spaces of the place of worship to limit the number of people in any one location - while avoiding risk of crowding at entry/exit points.</li>
  <li>Where social distancing cannot be maintained, extra attention needs to be paid to cleaning and hygiene to reduce the risk of transmission. Consider how well ventilated the venue is and improve this where possible, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Following the guidance on hand hygiene:
    <ul>
      <li>Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds using soap and water or hand sanitiser, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose, or after being in public areas.</li>
      <li>When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or the crook of your sleeved arm (not your hands) if you don’t have a tissue, and throw the tissue away hygienically immediately afterwards. Then wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds using soap and water or hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above advice on social distancing also applies when travelling to and from a place of worship. Decisions to reopen car parks are to be made locally and practical measures such as changing the car park layout to help people socially distance should be considered. Guidance on social distancing relevant to transport, parking and the public realm can be found here <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">guidance for passengers who need to travel during the coronavirus outbreak</a>. This is being regularly reviewed and updated.</p>

<h3 id="people-who-are-symptomatic">People who are symptomatic</h3>

<p>Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should not attend the place of worship due to the risk that they pose to others; they should self-isolate at home immediately with other members of their household. Remote participation should be considered, for example by live streaming. This applies equally to individuals who work at the place of worship.
Individuals who are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household</p>

<p>Where individuals are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household, or because they have been requested to so by NHS Test &amp; Trace, they must only participate remotely. See stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Guidance is different for funerals, see guidance on managing a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic here.</p>

<h3 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On entering and leaving a place of worship, everyone, including staff, should be asked to wash their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds using soap and water or to use hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available. A Public Health England poster can be downloaded here.</li>
  <li>There should be signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into the crook of your sleeved arm if a tissue is not available.</li>
  <li>You should provide hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to toilet facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toilets">Toilets</h3>

<p>Toilets inside or linked to places of worship should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Steps that will usually be needed to make the use of toilets as safe as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using signs and posters (see Hygiene above).</li>
  <li>Using social distancing marking in areas where queues normally form, and the adoption of a limited entry approach, with one in, one out (whilst avoiding the creation of additional bottlenecks).</li>
  <li>To enable good hand hygiene make hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical, and ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand dryers) are available. Communal towels should be removed and replaced with single use paper towels.</li>
  <li>Set clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider the use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces.</li>
  <li>Keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate and safe to do so.</li>
  <li>Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</li>
  <li>Putting up a visible cleaning schedule that is kept up to date and visible.</li>
  <li>Providing more waste facilities and more frequent refuse collection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cleaning">Cleaning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All surfaces, especially those most frequently touched such as door handles and rails, should be regularly cleaned using standard cleaning products. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>. Sufficient time needs to be allowed for this cleaning to take place, particularly before reopening for the first time. Frequently used objects, surfaces or spaces, including for example doorways between outside and inside spaces should be given particular attention when cleaning.</li>
  <li>Historic England has also produced <a rel="external" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/coronavirus/historic-places/cleaning-historic-surfaces/" class="govuk-link">guidance on cleaning historic surfaces</a>, which might not be suitable for cleaning using standard cleaning products.</li>
  <li>A decision should be made locally on how frequently cleaning should take place based on an assessment of risk and use of the building.</li>
  <li>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste#cleaning-waste" class="govuk-link">guidance on waste disposal in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protecting-the-vulnerable">Protecting the vulnerable</h3>

<p>There should be a particular focus on protecting people who are clinically vulnerable and more likely to develop severe illness. Actions should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Religious leaders, lay people, family, volunteers, staff and members of the public, including children, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">staying at home and self-isolating</a> if they have a new, continuous cough or a high temperature or loss of or change to sense of smell or taste. This is to minimise risk of spread of COVID-19 to friends, the wider community, and particularly the vulnerable.</li>
  <li>If anyone becomes unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 in a place of worship they should go home immediately and be advised to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance, which covers NHS Test and Trace</a>. If they need clinical advice, they should go online to NHS 111 (or call 111 if they don’t have internet access). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. They should not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other people who may have been in contact with the person who has become unwell should wash their hands thoroughly after the interaction, but they do not need to take any other specific action unless they develop symptoms themselves or are advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace. If they do develop symptoms they should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="individuals-aged-70-years-and-over-attending-the-place-of-worship">Individuals aged 70 years and over attending the place of worship</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Certain groups of people may be at increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19, including people who are aged 70 or older, regardless of medical conditions.</li>
  <li>Individuals who fall within this group are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if they do go out, to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside of their household.</li>
  <li>You should consider informing these groups in particular of the symptoms of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">current stay alert and social distancing guidance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section6">
<span class="number">6. </span> How can places of worship communicate this guidance to visitors?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Each place of worship is strongly advised to put the measures set out in this guidance in place to ensure that visitors follow government’s guidance, and any risk assessments advised, are completed for the venue, for the safety of all those who visit and work there. The government strongly advises each place of worship ensures that visitors follow  social distancing guidelines.</li>
  <li>Many faiths have issued specific guidance to their faith communities about some of these issues. You may wish to make the government’s information on COVID-19 available to your faith community and others, in order to challenge misinformation.</li>
  <li>You may also wish to remind members of the community about your area’s COVID local alert level, and highlight any additional restrictions regarding social mixing that this may cause.</li>
  <li>You should consider informing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#clinically-extremely-vulnerable-groups" class="govuk-link">certain groups of people</a> who may be at increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19, of the symptoms of COVID-19 and current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home and social distancing guidance</a>, and strongly discourage them from attending faith gatherings during this time or set aside a time for them to attend for individual devotions.</li>
  <li>Places of worship and faith leaders should consider how guidance can be communicated to visitors, including before they visit, in a way that is accessible and appropriate for the cultures, languages and reading levels of communities served by the place of worship.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section7">
<span class="number">7. </span> Protective security</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Adapting a place of worship to COVID-19 measures will inevitably result in changes to operating policies, processes and procedures at the place of worship. Any changes to these should always be considered with regard to security implications.</li>
  <li>Inputting this guidance places of worship in place should continue to take account of protective security considerations to maintain effective security of the premises, all staff and visitors, especially around entry and exit procedures, and any queueing or crowding outside the building where people can be more exposed.</li>
  <li>Individuals with responsibility for the security of the venue should be consulted and involved throughout to help ensure good security is maintained as far as possible and that there are not any unintended security consequences as a result of any changes that are made. An assessment of risk  should be undertaken on any new measures or changes in operation to ensure risks have been considered and all practical actions taken to reduce the risk of transmission  identified and put in place</li>
  <li>It is up to each place of worship to assess the level of risk, and places of worship may choose to delay opening if they do not feel they are able to safely do so under current social distancing measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the process of completing a risk assessment you should consider the security factors at <strong><a href="#sectionA" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="section8">
<span class="number">8. </span>  Enforcement</h2>

<p>It is important to be aware of the enforcement provisions, as is the case for other sectors.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority (your local authority), identifies responsible individuals who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks (including this guidance), they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Under existing <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm" class="govuk-link">Health &amp; Safety legislation</a>, failure to complete a risk assessment that accounts for COVID-19 could constitute a breach of that legislation, as could having a risk assessment with insufficient measures, and could also lead to a breach of</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1103/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Medium) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1104/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1105/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Local COVID-19 Alert Level) (Very High) (England) Regulations 2020</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to such actions of any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authority. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against COVID-19 by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<h2 id="sectionA">Annex A: Risk assessment for protective security - factors to consider</h2>

<p>A risk assessment that considers protective security should be conducted in addition to, or as part of, any health and safety/ fire safety or other broader assessment of the hazards and threats to the people in and around the place of worship as a result of changes made to how that place of worship functions.</p>

<h3 id="queues-social-distancing-and-security">Queues, social distancing and security</h3>

<p>Whilst busy crowding is unlikely if social distancing is operating correctly, the revised layout of spaces could present new security risks, particularly where multiple queues are created. Consideration should be given to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Venue managers should wherever possible, and in line with social distancing, organise queuing within existing protected areas; venue managers should not remove any security features or useful street furniture items without considering protective security in the round.</li>
  <li>If queuing is only possible outside of protected areas then venue managers should consider and mitigate any vulnerabilities by: routing queues behind permanent physical structures (such as street furniture, bollards, trolley parks &amp; bike racks) to provide a visual deterrent and delay; closing off vehicle access to shared spaces; adjusting servicing and delivery times; reducing the opportunities for vehicles to interact with pedestrians; erecting robust barriers; introducing a reduced speed limit mandated using traffic calming.</li>
  <li>Venue managers should avoid making public at the site or online, detailed information about queue locations, times and number of people or removal of security features such as street furniture and bollards.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="staff-security-officers-volunteers-and-stewarding">Staff, security officers/ volunteers and stewarding</h3>

<p>It is vital for staff to remain vigilant and act on potential security threats including terrorism and wider criminality. They should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continue to ensure that awareness of security threats is raised alongside health and safety risks through staff briefings.</li>
  <li>Whilst stewards, and in some cases security officers, may be focussed on managing people and queues for COVID-19 safety reasons, they should continue to remain vigilant for and report any suspicious activity as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Ideally consider having separate stewarding for managing social distancing and health and safety aspects, and for security as this will allow proper due attention to be given to keeping the site safe from threats.</li>
  <li>Ensure there is a good communication system in place to inform people of any incident. Carry out a short exercise or test to check procedures and equipment for this are working correctly.</li>
</ul>

        "text": "<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 are outlined by Public Health England. The transmission of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces. The predominant modes of transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.</p><p>This guidance for places of worship has been drafted on the basis of the scientific evidence available and will be updated as necessary as more data becomes available on this virus.</p><p>Places of worship play an important role in providing spiritual leadership for many individuals, and in bringing communities and generations together. However, their communal nature also makes them places that are particularly vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p><p>Through its Places of Worship Taskforce, the government has worked with faith leaders and representatives to develop this guidance to enable the safe reopening of places of worship.</p><p>This guidance is applicable in England alongside the relevant associated changes to the law.</p><p>This guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation.</p><p>On 12 October the government introduced a system of local COVID alert levels. If you live, work or volunteer in an area that is part of local COVID alert level: high or local COVID alert level: very high, there are additional restrictions which apply to you.</p><p>In general, these additional restrictions do not have significant implications for Places of Worship. Where they do, they have been included in this guidance.</p><p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – medium restrictions, when meeting friends and family you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with) you must not meet in a group of more than 6, indoors or outdoors.</p><p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – high” restrictions, you must not mix outside of your household or support bubble indoors, including within a place of worship.</p><p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – very high” restrictions, you must not mix outside of your household or support bubble indoors, including within a place of worship, or outdoors.</p><p>Please visit the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know\" class=\"govuk-link\">local COVID alert levels page</a> to find out what level your area is in and the additional restrictions that apply.</p><h3 id=\"meeting-other-people-in-places-of-worship\">Meeting other people in places of worship</h3><p>In areas subject to “COVID alert level – medium restrictions, when meeting friends and family you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with) you must not meet in a group of more than 6, indoors or outdoors. This includes places of worship.</p><p>At high and very high levels, you must not meet with friends and family indoors in any setting, including a place of worship, unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You must also not meet with people outside of your household or support bubble in a private garden or in most outdoor public venues.</p><p>This is against the law and the police will have the powers to enforce these legal limits, including to issue fines (fixed penalty notices) of £200, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £6,400.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing\" class=\"govuk-link\">meeting with others safely (social distancing) guidance</a>.</p><p>Whilst engaging in an activity in the place of worship or surrounding grounds, all parties should adhere to social distancing guidelines at all times, even within a group of six or where a specific activity-based exemption is applicable. This means people should be 2 metres apart or more than 1 metre apart as well as taking extra steps to stay safe (such as wearing face coverings) to reduce the risk of transmission.</p><h3 id=\"summarising-the-position-for-places-of-worship\">Summarising the position for places of worship</h3><p>The following list sets out where the number of people must be limited within a place of worship due to the potential for increased spread of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Activity: Communal worship, including prayers, devotions or meditations led by a Minister of Religion or lay person</strong></p><p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p><p>Limits for communal worship should be decided on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk (see Section 5 ‘Restrictions on Capacity’).</p><p>People must follow the restrictions on social mixing set out by their area’s COVID Local Alert Level and adhere to social distancing between households.</p><p>In local ‘COVID alert level - medium’ areas people must not mingle in a group of more than 6 (other than with those they live with or have formed a support bubble with).</p><p>In ‘local COVID alert level: high’ or ‘very high’, people must not mingle with anyone they do not live with or have formed a support bubble with.</p><p><strong>Activity: Marriage ceremonies</strong></p><p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p><p>Marriages, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies must have no more than 15 people.

Examples include a wake, a stone setting ceremony or the scattering of ashes.</p><p>Such events must have no more than 15 people in attendance, excluding those who are present for work purposes.</p><p>Such gatherings cannot take place in a private dwelling or garden.</p><p><strong>Activity: Significant life events (outside of marriage ceremonies and funerals)</strong></p><p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p><p>Where such events are an element of communal worship, they are subject to the requirements for communal worship set out above.</p><p>Otherwise, such events are subject to wider rules around social mixing dependent on an area’s COVID local alert level.</p><p>This means that, in a COVID-19 secure venue or public outdoor place, there can be more than 6 people in total present from multiple households. In ‘local COVID alert level: medium’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of 6.

In these situations, adults should maintain social distancing with other adults from different households.</p><p><strong>Activity: Support groups</strong></p><p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p><p>Support groups can take place with up to a maximum of 15 people in a public place, if the support group is organised by a business, a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support to its members or those who attend its meetings.</p><p>This includes, but is not limited to, providing support:</p><ul>\n  <li>to victims of crime (including domestic abuse)</li>\n  <li>to those with, or recovering from, addictions (including alcohol, narcotics or other substance addictions) or addictive patterns of behaviour</li>\n  <li>to new and expectant parents</li>\n  <li>to those with, or caring for persons with, any long-term illness, disability or terminal condition or who are vulnerable</li>\n  <li>to those facing issues related to their sexuality or identity including those living as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender</li>\n  <li>to those who have suffered bereavement</li>\n</ul><p>This is an exemption to the legal gatherings limits at all alert levels.</p><p>Support groups not covered by this exemption can still take place if they do not breach the new gatherings limits at each alert level.  This means that for these other groups, in a COVID-19 Secure venue or public outdoor place, there can be more than 6 people in total present from multiple households. In ‘local COVID alert level - medium’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of 6. In ‘local COVID alert levels - high’ and ‘very high’ areas, social interaction and shared activity must be limited to groups of the same household or support bubble.</p><p>Where this is unlikely to be possible, groups should not take place. Anybody who is working in facilitating the group or attending for work purposes is not included.</p><p><strong>Activity: Small prayer and study groups</strong></p><p><strong>Gathering limit</strong>:</p><p>Limits for prayer and study groups should be decided on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk (see Section 5 ‘Restrictions on Capacity</p><p>In ‘local COVID alert level - medium’ areas, People people must not mingle in a group of more than 6 (other than with those they live with or have formed a support bubble with).</p><p>In ‘local COVID alert level: high’ or ‘very high’ areas, people must not mingle in groups with anyone they do not live with or have formed a support bubble with.</p><h3 id=\"other-guidance\">Other guidance</h3><p>This guidance applies to places of worship when being used for a religious purpose or in preparation for a religious purpose.</p><p>For permitted uses of a place of worship not included in this guidance, you should refer to the specific guidance linked below:</p><ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/the-visitor-economy\" class=\"govuk-link\">Tourism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches\" class=\"govuk-link\">retail</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/reopening-and-adapting-your-food-business-during-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\">restaurants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/hotels-and-other-guest-accommodation\" class=\"govuk-link\">other hospitality industries</a>\n</li>\n  <li>Meetings or small gatherings, as permitted in other <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities\" class=\"govuk-link\">multi-purpose community settings</a>\n</li>\n  <li>Places of worship should take account of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts\" class=\"govuk-link\">performing arts guidance</a> in organising any indoor or outdoor performances, paying particular attention to the sections on singing.</li>\n</ul>"

The guidance sets out how this can be done in a manner that is COVID-19 secure and in line with social distancing guidelines, in order to minimise the risk of exposure to infection.</p><h3 id=\"definitions-for-the-purposes-of-this-guidance\">Definitions for the purposes of this guidance</h3><p><strong>“Place of worship”</strong></p><p>A place of worship refers to a building used for regular religious ceremonies, communal worship or similar gatherings by religious organisations. It includes the use of surrounding grounds, for example, adjoining carparks, courtyards or gardens for which the venue managers are also responsible.</p><p>The guidance also covers premises when being used for religious gatherings, even when their primary purpose is not for religious gatherings, such as a community centre. These premises will only be able to be used where they are permitted to be open and additional guidance may be applicable.</p><p>This guidance does not cover public parks, private homes, cultural sites or other open spaces, such as woodlands which may be used for religious purposes. If people do want to engage in worship in these spaces, then the guidance relevant to that place should be adhered to.</p><p><strong>“Significant life cycle events”</strong></p><p>Events to mark or celebrate a significant milestone in a person’s life, according to their religion or belief, such as events to celebrate a person’s birth (other than a birthday) or coming of age.

It is advised that the ceremonies and services should be concluded in the shortest reasonable time.</p><p>Once completed, participants should be encouraged to move on promptly, to minimise the risk of contact and spread of infection. If appropriate, you should reconfigure spaces to enable worshippers to be seated rather than standing which reduces the risk of contact.</p><p>Worshippers should limit their interactions dependent on their area’s COVID local alert level. At the medium level they should interact only with the group of 6 they entered the place of worship with. At the high and very high levels, additional restrictions apply and worshippers must not mix outside of their households. These restrictions still apply for significant life cycle events, but do not apply to weddings or funerals.</p><p>It is recommended that, where possible, places of worship continue to stream worship or other events to avoid large gatherings and to continue to reach those individuals who are self-isolating or particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.</p><p>More specific guidance is as follows.</p><h3 id=\"the-use-of-shared-items\">The use of shared items</h3><ul>\n  <li>Individuals should be prevented from touching or kissing objects that are handled communally. Barriers and/or clear signage should be put in place where necessary to avoid this taking place.</li>\n  <li>Individuals should also avoid touching property belonging to others such as shoes which, if removed, should be placed and collected by their owner while adhering to social distancing principles.</li>\n  <li>Reusable and communal resources such as prayer mats, service sheets, religious texts or devotional material should be removed from use. Single use alternatives should be provided as long as they are removed and disposed of by the worshipper.</li>\n  <li>Items owned by the individual to aid worship such as a prayer mat or religious text, can be brought in but should be removed again by the worshipper.</li>\n  <li>In circumstances where worshippers cannot bring their own books, places of worship should keep a selection of clean books for individuals to use. Clean books should be quarantined for 48 hours since their previous use and should be quarantined for 48 hours again after use. Items which cannot be easily cleaned should also be subject to the 48 hour quarantine after use.</li>\n  <li>Please also refer to specific cleaning advice below.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"food-and-drink\">Food and drink</h3><ul>\n  <li>Where food or drink (‘consumables’) are essential to the act of worship, they can be used, however the sharing of food should be avoided, as should the use of communal vessels.</li>\n  <li>If it is necessary to handle consumables as a part of a faith practice, those giving and receiving food items should wash their hands thoroughly before and after consumption, or wear gloves.</li>\n  <li>The person distributing the consumable should release it, into the hand only, in such a way to avoid any contact between them and those receiving it, or wear gloves. If accidental contact does occur, both people should cleanse their hands immediately.</li>\n  <li>Other actions taken to reduce the risk of transmission should also be considered, for example, foodstuffs should be prewrapped, and a system should be in place to prevent individuals from coming into contact with consumables and any dishes and/ or cutlery other than their own (for example the use of shared bowls).</li>\n  <li>Speaking, singing and chanting should not happen across uncovered consumables (other than consumables to be used by the celebrant alone). Instead consumables should be securely covered, and prior to the receptacle being opened, it should be cleaned, hands should be washed or gloves worn.</li>\n  <li>Hospitality spaces within a place of worship, such as cafes, are permitted to open but should be limited to table-service, social distancing should be observed, and with minimal staff and customer contact in line with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery\" class=\"govuk-link\">hospitality guidance</a>.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"singing-chanting-and-the-use-of-musical-instruments\">Singing, chanting and the use of musical instruments</h3><p>What the leader(s) and performers can and cannot do:</p><ul>\n  <li>For performance during worship (and rehearsals), both indoors and outdoors those performing in:\n    <ul>\n      <li>a professional capacity; and</li>\n      <li>those under 18 where supervised, \n<br>are not limited in number.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>In all other cases, where the number of adult performers will be greater than 6, each group of up to 6 performers should ensure that they do not mix and that appropriate social distancing requirements are observed.</li>\n  <li>Singing should be limited to the performers, and worship should not include congregational singing.</li>\n  <li>Places of worship should take account of the Performing Arts guidance which outlines additional mitigations such as good ventilation.</li>\n  <li>Where music plays a big part in worship, and recordings are available, we suggest you consider using these as an alternative to live singing to mitigate risks.</li>\n  <li>Any instrument played during worship should be cleaned thoroughly before and after use.</li>\n  <li>Avoid playing music at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult or that may encourage shouting when people will be trying to converse before or after worship.</li>\n</ul><p>What the congregation can and cannot do</p><ul>\n  <li>People should avoid singing, shouting and raising voices. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.</li>\n  <li>Activities such as singing, chanting, shouting and/or playing of instruments that are blown into should be specifically avoided by congregations/worshippers. This is because there is a possible additional risk of transmission in environments where individuals are singing or chanting as a group, and this applies even if social distancing is being observed or face coverings are used.</li>\n  <li>Therefore, spoken responses during worship should also not be in a raised voice.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"weddings-funerals-and-commemorative-events\">Weddings, funerals and commemorative events</h3><p>It is strongly advised that only essential aspects of the ceremonies take place at this time.</p><h3 id=\"weddings\">Weddings</h3><p>Weddings can continue to take place with up to 15 people.</p><ul>\n  <li>No food or drink should be consumed as a part of the event unless required for the purposes of solemnisation.</li>\n  <li>Those attending should socially distance from anyone they do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with).</li>\n  <li>Wedding receptions can take place in areas that are subject to medium or high COVID local alert levels, with up to 15 people in the form of a sit down meal.

The number of people who are able to gather will therefore be dependent on the size of the space available.</li>\n  <li>A risk assessment should also consider the security of worshippers. This may require involving local partners such as the police.</li>\n</ul><h4 id=\"public-outdoor-spaces\">Public outdoor spaces</h4><ul>\n  <li>For acts of worship taking place away from the place of worship and surrounding grounds please follow the relevant guidance on the number of people permitted to gather in those spaces.</li>\n  <li>If anyone is considering arranging an event for more than 6 people in a public outdoor space they should liaise with those responsible for the open space in question to ensure that the event can be staged in a safe and legal way, which includes undertaking a risk assessment that considers security (see Annex A).</li>\n  <li>Talk to your local authority about any large events you want to hold – you should be aware that some local authorities have powers under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 to impose restrictions on events or on public outdoor spaces by direction, if certain criteria are met.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"use-of-water\">Use of water</h3><ul>\n  <li>Any pre-requisite washing/ablution rituals should not be done at the place of worship but carried out prior to arrival.</li>\n  <li>In rare circumstances where it is necessary, washing facilities within the place of worship should be used in line with social distancing guidelines and hygiene measures applied.</li>\n  <li>People should not wash the body parts of others.</li>\n  <li>Where rituals or ceremonies require water to be applied to the body others present should move out of range of any potential splashing.</li>\n  <li>Where an infant is involved a parent/guardian or other member of the infant’s regular household should hold the infant.</li>\n  <li>All individuals involved should thoroughly wash their hands before and after and ensure good hygiene.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"full-immersion\">Full immersion</h3><ul>\n  <li>Where full immersion in water is necessary as part of a ritual or ceremony, this should be very carefully planned following the rules below.</li>\n  <li>Those being immersed should be at least 2 metres away from the congregation and officiants at all times, except while they are being immersed.</li>\n  <li>Only one person should be immersed at any time and they should only be attended by a single officiant/clergy member.</li>\n  <li>During the immersion, clergy/the officiant can place their hands on the head of the person being immersed, but they should not ‘cradle’ the person or touch them in any other way</li>\n  <li>Clergy/the officiant should wash their hands after each person is immersed, or if this isn’t possible they should use hand sanitiser.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"cash-donations\">Cash donations</h3><ul>\n  <li>Where possible faith leaders should discourage cash donations and continue to use online or contactless giving and resources.</li>\n  <li>Where this is not an option, cash should be collected in a receptacle that is set in one place and handled by one individual, as opposed to being passed around. Regular cleaning and hygiene should be maintained, and gloves worn to handle cash offerings where giving continues.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"young-people-and-children-attending-places-of-worship\">Young people and children attending places of worship</h3><ul>\n  <li>Organised children’s activities can take place within a place of worship, and are limited to the number of people who can safely social distance in the venue in line with COVID-19 secure guidance. These can include, but not limited to activities such as mother and baby groups, youth groups and classes.</li>\n  <li>Specific guidance for out-of-school settings has been published and should be followed when providing tuition, training, instruction or activities outside normal school hours (such as evenings, weekends, school holidays). This includes advice to keep children in consistent groups of 15.</li>\n  <li>Some running youth groups will also want to refer to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nya.org.uk/guidance/\" class=\"govuk-link\">National Youth Agency guidance</a> which also recommends groups of 15, and discusses the use of face coverings for over 11s.</li>\n  <li>Where adults are supervising young children, they should maintain social distancing from adults from other households.</li>\n  <li>For formal childcare and educational settings refer to the relevant guidance.</li>\n  <li>Young children should be supervised by the parent or guardian outside of organised children’s activities. They should wash hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly or use hand sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.</li>\n  <li>Places of worship can help remind children and young people, and their parents and guardians, of the important actions they should take during the COVID-19 outbreak to help prevent the spread of the virus. Posters on general hand hygiene can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools\" class=\"govuk-link\">eBug website</a>.</li>\n  <li>Any shared facilities for children, such as play corners, soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean, should be removed and/or put out of use.</li>\n  <li>Outdoor playgrounds are permitted to open where venue managers risk assess that it is safe to do so, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance</a>.

The service:</p><ul>\n  <li>provides testing for anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus to find out if they have the virus</li>\n  <li>gets in touch with anyone who has had a positive test result to help them share information about any close recent contacts they have had</li>\n  <li>alerts those contacts, where necessary, and notifies them they need to self-isolate to help stop the spread of the virus</li>\n</ul><p>Further information can be found online including for contacts of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person and for places of work.</p><p>Venues should assist this service by keeping a temporary record of visitors for 21 days, in a way that is manageable for your place of worship, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed for contact tracing and the investigation of local outbreaks. You should also display official NHS QR code posters so that those with the app can scan in if they choose.</p><p>Find further information on maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace.</p><p>When collecting the names and contact details of people attending your place of worship, you should ask for their consent. This is because of the potentially sensitive nature of the data collected in these circumstances, which is protected by law. Guidance on collecting visitor details for Test and Trace, including issues around consent, is provided by the Information Commissioner’s Office. You should make clear that giving contact details is optional and is not a condition of attending your place of worship. We have created a template form for collecting consent at places of worship, available in Annex B.</p><h3 id=\"face-coverings\">Face coverings</h3><p>In England, face coverings are currently required by law to be worn in places of worship.</p><p>There are valid exemptions for some individuals and groups to not wear a face covering in these settings. In particular, those who are leading services or events in a place of worship, and those who assist them (for instance by reading, preaching, or leading prayer) do not always need to wear a face covering, although one should be worn especially if physical distancing cannot be maintained (i.e. distributing consumables) This exemption does not apply to worshippers, who should wear face coverings consistent with the requirements for any other public space.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on the wearing of face coverings at a place of work</a>. For more information please see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on face coverings</a> on GOV.UK.</p><h3 id=\"restrictions-on-capacity\">Restrictions on capacity</h3><p>Limits for communal worship should be decided locally on the basis of the capacity of the place of worship following an assessment of risk. The number of people permitted to enter the place of worship at any one time should be limited, should maintain social distancing between households or support bubbles.</p><ul>\n  <li>The size and circumstance (including ventilation) of the premises will determine the maximum number of people that can be accommodated whilst also facilitating social distancing; this may therefore be lower than the maximum 30 people who can attend a funeral, or the 15 who may attend a wedding.</li>\n  <li>The safe number of people should be decided by the venue manager.</li>\n  <li>In defining the number of people that can reasonably follow social distancing, the total floorspace as well as likely pinch points and busy areas should be taken into account (such as entrances, exits) and where possible alternative or one-way routes introduced.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"social-distancing\">Social distancing</h3><p>Social distancing measures are actions to reduce social interaction between people in order to minimise the opportunity for transmission of COVID-19.</p><p>All managers and all visitors to a place of worship  must  follow the law and should follow the guidance on social distancing including:</p><ul>\n  <li>Adhering to social distancing, meaning people should be 2 metres apart or more than 1 metre apart as well as taking extra steps to stay safe (such as wearing face coverings) to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>\n  <li>For frequently used places, mark areas using floor tape or paint to help people maintain social distance.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that groups attending communal worship together do not exceed more than 6 people per group. In medium local alert level areas, the law allows for multiple groups of 6 people to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle. Any group of 6 can be made up of people from different households. In high or very high level areas, the law allows for multiple households and support bubbles to participate, provided that these groups do not mingle. Strict social distancing must be maintained between members of different households at all times.</li>\n  <li>The only exception to this where a single household or support bubble is larger than 6 people. In this case, the single household or support bubble may attend communal worship together.</li>\n</ul><p>You should consider and set out the additional actions you will take to reduce the risk of transmission in your risk assessment. These could include, for instance, avoiding any face-to-face seating by changing layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, and closing non-essential social spaces, as outlined throughout this guidance.</p><p>Queue management is important so the flow of groups in and out of the premises can be carefully controlled in a socially distanced way, reducing the risk of congestion or contact. Considerations should be made for how to manage those waiting outside a place of worship, including the introduction of socially distanced queuing systems.</p><p>All religious practices should be carried out to try ensure social distancing can be maintained between individuals from different households. This is to reduce the risk of transmission. There should only be a closer distance when absolutely essential to enable a faith practice to be carried out (for example contact with the faith leader). Time spent in contact should be kept to an absolute minimum.</p><p>Other actions to take to reduce the risk of transmission to support social distancing could include:</p><ul>\n  <li>Those leading the worship reminding congregants of the importance of social distancing and hygiene.</li>\n  <li>Introducing a one-way flow in and out of the premises with appropriate floor markings or signage, with restrictions on accessing non-essential areas. At the end of worship, this could include worshippers leaving one row at a time, in order to prevent crowding at entry or exit points.</li>\n  <li>Multiple entry points could be opened, and clear signposting or assistance could be offered to guide worshippers and to avoid congestion.</li>\n  <li>Staggering arrival and departure times will reduce the flow at exits and entrances as well as reduce any impacts on public transport. Venues could also consider introducing a booking system to help facilitate this. You may want to consider how prioritisation could be given to people who may have a specific need or requirement.</li>\n  <li>Using screens, barriers or alternative rooms and spaces to separate worshippers.</li>\n  <li>Any changes to entrances, exits and queues should take into account reasonable adjustments to accommodate those who need them, such as worshippers with physical disabilities.</li>\n  <li>Introducing a booking system to help with managing numbers, particularly for services where demand will be high.</li>\n  <li>Venue managers advertising set days or times when places of worship are open solely for those particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, such as those over 70 or clinically vulnerable.</li>\n  <li>Leading worship in different spaces of the place of worship to limit the number of people in any one location - while avoiding risk of crowding at entry/exit points.</li>\n  <li>Where social distancing cannot be maintained, extra attention needs to be paid to cleaning and hygiene to reduce the risk of transmission. Consider how well ventilated the venue is and improve this where possible, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate.</li>\n  <li>Following the guidance on hand hygiene:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds using soap and water or hand sanitiser, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose, or after being in public areas.</li>\n      <li>When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or the crook of your sleeved arm (not your hands) if you don’t have a tissue, and throw the tissue away hygienically immediately afterwards. Then wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds using soap and water or hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul><p>The above advice on social distancing also applies when travelling to and from a place of worship. Decisions to reopen car parks are to be made locally and practical measures such as changing the car park layout to help people socially distance should be considered. Guidance on social distancing relevant to transport, parking and the public realm can be found here <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance for passengers who need to travel during the coronavirus outbreak</a>. This is being regularly reviewed and updated.</p><h3 id=\"people-who-are-symptomatic\">People who are symptomatic</h3><p>Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should not attend the place of worship due to the risk that they pose to others; they should self-isolate at home immediately with other members of their household. Remote participation should be considered, for example by live streaming. This applies equally to individuals who work at the place of worship.\nIndividuals who are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household</p><p>Where individuals are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household, or because they have been requested to so by NHS Test &amp; Trace, they must only participate remotely. See stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Guidance is different for funerals, see guidance on managing a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic here.</p><h3 id=\"hygiene\">Hygiene</h3><ul>\n  <li>On entering and leaving a place of worship, everyone, including staff, should be asked to wash their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds using soap and water or to use hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available. A Public Health England poster can be downloaded here.</li>\n  <li>There should be signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into the crook of your sleeved arm if a tissue is not available.</li>\n  <li>You should provide hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to toilet facilities.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"toilets\">Toilets</h3><p>Toilets inside or linked to places of worship should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Steps that will usually be needed to make the use of toilets as safe as possible:</p><ul>\n  <li>Using signs and posters (see Hygiene above).</li>\n  <li>Using social distancing marking in areas where queues normally form, and the adoption of a limited entry approach, with one in, one out (whilst avoiding the creation of additional bottlenecks).</li>\n  <li>To enable good hand hygiene make hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical, and ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand dryers) are available. Communal towels should be removed and replaced with single use paper towels.</li>\n  <li>Set clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider the use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces.</li>\n  <li>Keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate and safe to do so.</li>\n  <li>Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</li>\n  <li>Putting up a visible cleaning schedule that is kept up to date and visible.</li>\n  <li>Providing more waste facilities and more frequent refuse collection.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"cleaning\">Cleaning</h3><ul>\n  <li>All surfaces, especially those most frequently touched such as door handles and rails, should be regularly cleaned using standard cleaning products. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance</a>. Sufficient time needs to be allowed for this cleaning to take place, particularly before reopening for the first time. Frequently used objects, surfaces or spaces, including for example doorways between outside and inside spaces should be given particular attention when cleaning.</li>\n  <li>Historic England has also produced <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/coronavirus/historic-places/cleaning-historic-surfaces/\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on cleaning historic surfaces</a>, which might not be suitable for cleaning using standard cleaning products.</li>\n  <li>A decision should be made locally on how frequently cleaning should take place based on an assessment of risk and use of the building.</li>\n  <li>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste#cleaning-waste\" class=\"govuk-link\">guidance on waste disposal in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"protecting-the-vulnerable\">Protecting the vulnerable</h3><p>There should be a particular focus on protecting people who are clinically vulnerable and more likely to develop severe illness. Actions should include:</p><ul>\n  <li>Religious leaders, lay people, family, volunteers, staff and members of the public, including children, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection\" class=\"govuk-link\">staying at home and self-isolating</a> if they have a new, continuous cough or a high temperature or loss of or change to sense of smell or taste. This is to minimise risk of spread of COVID-19 to friends, the wider community, and particularly the vulnerable.</li>\n  <li>If anyone becomes unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 in a place of worship they should go home immediately and be advised to follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection\" class=\"govuk-link\">stay at home guidance, which covers NHS Test and Trace</a>. If they need clinical advice, they should go online to NHS 111 (or call 111 if they don’t have internet access). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. They should not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.</li>\n</ul><p>Other people who may have been in contact with the person who has become unwell should wash their hands thoroughly after the interaction, but they do not need to take any other specific action unless they develop symptoms themselves or are advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace. If they do develop symptoms they should follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection\" class=\"govuk-link\">stay at home guidance</a>.</p><h3 id=\"individuals-aged-70-years-and-over-attending-the-place-of-worship\">Individuals aged 70 years and over attending the place of worship</h3><ul>\n  <li>Certain groups of people may be at increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19, including people who are aged 70 or older, regardless of medical conditions.</li>\n  <li>Individuals who fall within this group are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if they do go out, to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside of their household.</li>\n  <li>You should consider informing these groups in particular of the symptoms of COVID-19 and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing\" class=\"govuk-link\">current stay alert and social distancing guidance</a>.</li>\n</ul>"
