This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.

This guidance is national guidance that applies across England. <br><br></p>

<p>This guidance is only applicable in England.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK is experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.</p>

<p>Places of worship play an important role in providing spiritual leadership for many individuals, and in bringing communities and generations together. However, their communal nature also makes them places that are vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Places of Worship do not need to fully close under the restrictions in place, but they may open only for a limited range of activities and events. These are set out in this guidance. The applicable law is <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1200/pdfs/uksi_20201200_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations2020</a></p>

<p>The government continues to work with its Places of Worship Taskforce and faith leaders to review and amend this guidance, as necessary, in line with the changing situation and to enable the safe reopening of places of worship for a broader range of activities as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This guidance is applicable in England alongside the relevant associated changes to the law.</p>

<h2 id="summarising-the-position-for-places-of-worship">Summarising the position for places of worship</h2>

<p>From Thursday 5 November national COVID-19 restrictions will apply in England. These restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require people to stay at home, except for specific purposes</li>
  <li>prevent people gathering with those they do not live with, except for specific purposes</li>
  <li>close certain businesses and venues</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november" class="govuk-link">guidance on these new national restrictions</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Under these restrictions, from 5 November places of worship in England must only open for the following purposes:  <br><br></p>

<h3 id="individual-prayerbrbr">Individual prayer<br><br>
</h3>

<p>A person, or single household, entering the venue to pray on their own and not as part of a group. Individual prayer does not cover attendance for led prayers or led services. Communal worship must not take place.<br><br></p>

<p>The number of individuals or households permitted in a place of worship at any one time will be dependent on the size of the building and ability to socially distance therein.<br><br></p>

<p>Precautions to stop people arriving at the same time should be taken, no matter the size of the building.<br><br></p>

<h3 id="funeralsbrbr">Funerals<br><br>
</h3>

<p>Funerals must have no more than 30 people.<br><br></p>

<p>Anyone working is not included as part of the 30 person limit. Please refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: guidance for managing a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.<br><br></p>

<h3 id="commemorative-events-to-celebrate-the-life-of-a-person-who-has-diedbrbr">Commemorative events to celebrate the life of a person who has died<br><br>
</h3>

<p>These are events which commemorate or mark the deceased’s passing. Examples include the scattering of ashes and stone setting ceremonies. This would not typically include regular communal worship services during which prayers for the deceased are said. Such events must now have no more than 15 people in attendance. Anyone working is not included as part of the 15 person limit.<br><br></p>

<h3 id="broadcasting-or-filming-an-act-of-worshipbrbr">Broadcasting or filming an act of worship<br><br>
</h3>

<p>Attending a place of worship for broadcasting or filming an act of worship is permitted but should only involve those people working or volunteering who are essential for the content of the service, and for technical support to enable people to watch and worship online or via a television or radio.<br><br></p>

<p>If musicians or singers usually form part of the act of worship that is being broadcast, they may participate but only if they are essential to the delivery of that act of worship. The numbers or people involved should be kept as small as possible to minimise risks and participants should follow social distancing guidance. <br><br></p>

<h3 id="childcare-and-educationbrbr">Childcare and education<br><br>
</h3>

<p>For formal childcare (if this is provided by a person registered on the Early Years Register under Part 3 of the Childcare Act 2006) and where the place of worship is used as part of a school. Numbers should be limited to the number of people who can safely socially distance in the venue in line with COVID-19 Secure guidance. See  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance for education and childcare settings: new national restrictions from 5 November 2020.</a> <br><br></p>

<h3 id="essential-voluntary-and-public-servicesbrbr">Essential voluntary and public services<br><br>
</h3>

<p>These will include the provision of food banks or other support for the homeless or vulnerable people, blood donation sessions, or support in an emergency. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-guidance-for-voluntary-community-and-social-enterprise-organisations" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 guidance for voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations</a>.<br><br></p>

<h3 id="support-groups-brbr">Support groups <br><br>
</h3>

<p>To enable support, groups that provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support can take place with up to 15 people attending, if the support group is organised by a business, a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body.<br><br></p>

<p>Examples include support to:<br><br></p>

<p>a) victims of crime (including domestic abuse)<br><br>
b) those with, or recovering from, addictions (including alcohol, narcotics or other substance addictions) or addictive patterns of behaviour<br><br>
c) new parents or guardians<br><br>
d) those with, or caring for persons with, any long-term illness or terminal condition or who are vulnerable<br><br>
e) those facing issues related to their sexuality or identity including those living as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender<br><br>
f) those who have suffered bereavement<br><br>
g) vulnerable young people, including to enable them to meet youth workers<br><br></p>

<p>The limit of 15 does not include children under 5 who are accompanying a parent or guardian. Anyone working would also not be included.</p>
</div>

<p>The following activities are examples (but not an exhaustive list) of what is <strong>not permitted</strong> in a Place of Worship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worshippers present to partake in communal, congregational or corporate worship (led devotions/worship/service/prayer by a Minister of Religion or lay person, e.g. Evensong, informal prayer meetings, Jummah, Mass or Kirtan)</li>
  <li>weddings (with the exception of those in the exceptional circumstances of someone not expected to recover from a serious illness), baptisms or other ceremonies which mark significant life cycle moments (except ceremonial events that celebrate the life of a person who has died as above)</li>
  <li>study groups</li>
  <li>lifestyle and leisure/recreational groups such as craft groups or exercise groups</li>
  <li>food that is served to be consumed on the premises</li>
  <li>amateur choir practice or group bell ringing</li>
  <li>tourism and shops contained within the place of worship</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="purpose-of-this-guidance">Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance is designed to assist places of worship in England to operate in accordance with the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020.</p>

<p>The guidance sets out how this can be done in a manner that is COVID-19 secure and minimises risks around exposure to infection.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-for-the-purposes-of-this-guidance">Definitions for the purposes of this guidance</h3>

<h4 id="place-of-worship">“Place of worship”</h4>

<p>A building used for regular religious ceremonies, prayers, communal worship or similar gatherings by religious organisations. It includes the use of surrounding grounds, for example, adjoining carparks, courtyards or gardens for which the venue managers are also responsible.</p>

<p>The guidance also covers premises when being used for religious gatherings (as above), even when their primary purpose is not for religious gatherings, such as a community centre. These premises will only be able to be used where they are permitted to be open and additional guidance may be applicable.</p>

<p>This guidance does not cover educational establishments, public parks, private homes, cultural sites or other open spaces, such as woodlands which may be used for religious purposes. If people do want to engage in worship in these spaces, then the guidance relevant to that place should be adhered to.</p>

<h4 id="worshippers-or-visitors">“Worshippers” or “Visitors”</h4>

<p>Those entering the place of worship to engage in worship or other activity for which the place of worship may be used.</p>

<h4 id="venue-managers">“Venue managers”</h4>

<p>The person or persons responsible for the management of an individual place of worship, including assessment of compliance with the following guidelines and relevant law. This may be a religious leader or volunteer.</p>

<h4 id="household-and-support-bubble">“Household” and “Support Bubble”</h4>

<p>A household is a person or a group of people who live together in the same accommodation.</p>

<p>A support bubble is where a single adult living alone, or a single parent with children under 18, can form an exclusive network with one other household where social distancing does not have to be observed.</p>

<p>The 2 households that form a support bubble count as one household for the purposes of this guidance.</p>

<h4 id="must">“Must”</h4>

<p>Where the guidance states that an activity must or must not take place this is because it is a requirement under the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 and therefore is a requirement in law.</p>

<h4 id="should">“Should”</h4>

<p>Where the guidance that an activity should or should not take place this is not a legal requirement under The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020  however, it is strongly advised that consideration is given to following the advice being given to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="key-principles">Key principles</h2>

<p>Each individual place of worship is strongly advised to apply this guidance with reference to its own specific circumstances, including its size and how it is operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>Venue managers for places of worship will have discretion over when they consider it safe to open for any of the purposes listed in Table 1 and as permitted by the Regulations. Places of wrship should close if they are not able to safely adhere to these guidelines.</p>

<p>Many places of worship are also workplaces and should therefore be aware of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">their responsibilities as employers under health and safety law</a>. Places of worship also have a duty of care to volunteers, to ensure that as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to how fair and equal access can safely be provided for all users to be able to undertake faith practices within a place of worship, in line with government guidelines and considering requirements under the Equality Act 2010 where these apply.</p>

<p>A COVID-19 risk assessment must be completed by each place of worship. This may be done in addition to any risk assessment already in place or as a separate assessment.</p>

<p>This link provides <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm" class="govuk-link">generic guidance on completing a risk assessment</a>. Assessments should be done in consultation with unions or workers (including volunteers and contractors) if relevant. It may also be beneficial to discuss the risk assessment with worshippers or other stakeholders (such as neighbouring tenants or property owners) to assist understanding among faith communities and local communities and improve reopening design and execution.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment that accounts for COVID-19 could constitute a breach of Health &amp; Safety legislation and could also lead to a breach of The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020.</p>

<h2 id="individual-prayer-within-a-place-of-worship">Individual prayer within a place of worship</h2>

<p>Individual prayer within a place of worship is defined as a person or household entering the venue to pray on their own and not as part of a group, led prayer or communal act.</p>

<p>Collective, communal or congregational prayer and regular scheduled services are not permitted. This includes a Minister of religion or lay person/volunteer leading devotions or prayer of any sort. If possible, arrangements should be made to record or live stream such services, enabling people to watch and worship online or via a television or radio.</p>

<p>Venue managers should engage and communicate with worshippers and the wider community to explain what activity is permitted and what is prohibited. The key principles are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining social distancing with other households at all times.</li>
  <li>Not gathering in groups, except with members of their own household, inside or outside the building. This is why congregational prayers are not permitted at this time. If you are opening for individual prayer, you should consider how to ensure visitors are spaced out (for example a simple booking system).</li>
  <li>Not touching or kissing devotional and other objects that may be handled by others. Barriers and/or clear signage should be put in place where necessary.</li>
  <li>Not touching property belonging to others such as shoes which, if removed, should be placed and collected by their owner while adhering to social distancing principles.</li>
  <li>Removing books, reusable and communal resources e.g. prayer mats, service sheets or devotional material. Single use alternatives can be provided as long as they are subsequently removed by the worshipper. Items owned by the individual to aid worship e.g. a prayer mat or religious text, may be brought in but should be removed again.</li>
  <li>Not making food or drink available to worshippers or visitors to be consumed on the premises.</li>
  <li>Avoiding singing and the playing of musical instruments.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that any pre-requisite washing/ablution rituals are done at home.</li>
  <li>Where possible, discouraging cash giving and continuing to use online giving and resources minimising contact around transactions. Regular cleaning and hygiene should be maintained, and gloves worn to handle cash offerings where giving continues.</li>
  <li>Wearing face coverings, unless exempt (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="restrictions-on-capacity">Restrictions on capacity</h2>

<p>Restrictions should be set locally by venue managers to limit the number of people permitted to enter the place of worship for individual prayer at any one time, so that a minimum safe distance of at least 2 metres (3 steps) in all directions can be maintained between all individuals or households. All possible precautions to stop people arriving at the same time should be taken, no matter the size of the building.</p>

<p>The size and circumstance of the premises will determine the maximum number of people that can be accommodated whilst also facilitating social distancing. In defining the number of people that can reasonably follow 2 metres distancing, the total floorspace as well as likely pinch points should be taken into account (e.g. entrances, exits) and where possible alternative or one-way routes introduced.</p>

<p>A risk assessment should be carried out to identify points of high risk in the building and mitigating action; such mitigating action should be taken where possible.</p>

<p>It is recommended that places of worship close to worshippers attending for individual prayer when another permitted activity (see Table 1) is taking place.</p>

<p>Venue managers might want to consider advertising set days or times when places of worship are open for individual prayer solely for those particularly vulnerable to coronavirus (COVID-19), e.g. those over 70 or clinically vulnerable.</p>

<h2 id="travel-to-and-from-a-place-of-worship">Travel to and from a place of worship</h2>

<p>The above advice on social distancing also applies when travelling to and from a place of worship.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">guidance for passengers who need to travel during the coronavirus outbreak</a>. This is being regularly reviewed and updated.</p>

<h2 id="test-and-trace">Test and trace</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace service</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides testing for anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 to find out if they have the virus</li>
  <li>gets in touch with anyone who has had a positive test result to help them share information about any close recent contacts they have had</li>
  <li>alerts those contacts, where necessary, and notifies them they need to self-isolate to help stop the spread of the virus</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information can be found online including for contacts of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person, and for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance#about-the-nhs-test-and-trace-service" class="govuk-link">places of work.</a>.</p>

<p>Venues should assist this service by keeping a temporary record of visitors for 21 days, in a way that is manageable for your place of worship, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed for contact tracing and the investigation of local outbreaks. You should also display official NHS QR code posters so that those with the app can scan in.</p>

<p>Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">further information</a> on maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors to support NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>When collecting the names and contact details of people attending your place of worship, you should ask for their consent. This is because of the potentially sensitive nature of the data collected in these circumstances, which is protected by law. Guidance on collecting visitor details for Test and Trace, including issues around consent, is provided by the Information Commissioner’s Office. You should make clear that giving contact details is optional and is not a condition of attending your place of worship. We have created a template form for collecting consent at places of worship, available in Annex A.</p>

<h2 id="face-coverings">Face coverings</h2>

<p>In England, face coverings are required by law to be worn in places of worship.</p>

<p>There are valid exemptions for some individuals and groups to not wear a face covering in these settings. In particular, those who are leading permitted services or events in a place of worship, and those who assist them</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on the wearing of face coverings at a place of work</a>. For more information please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="social-distancing">Social distancing</h2>

<p>Social distancing measures are actions to reduce social interaction between people in order to minimise the opportunity for transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>All venue managers and all visitors to a place of worship must follow the law and should follow the guidance on social distancing including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adhering to social distancing, stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings or increasing ventilation indoors) to reduce the risk of transmission</li>
  <li>for frequently used places, mark areas using floor tape or paint to help people maintain social distance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="people-who-are-symptomatic">People who are symptomatic</h2>

<p>Anyone showing symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should not attend the place of worship due to the risk that they pose to others; they should self-isolate at home immediately with other members of their household. Remote participation should be considered, for example by live streaming. This applies equally to individuals who work at the place of worship.</p>

<p>Individuals who are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household</p>

<p>Where individuals are self-isolating due to a possible or confirmed case of COVID-19 in the household, or because they have been requested to so by NHS Test &amp; Trace, they must only participate remotely.</p>

<p>For a funeral, even if you are a close family member of the deceased, we strongly recommend that you attend remotely, if possible, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread to other mourners. However, if after careful consideration of the risk, you choose to attend in person, it is essential that you follow the precautions outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>

<p>On entering and leaving a place of worship, everyone, including staff, should be asked to wash their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds using soap and water, or to use hand sanitiser if hand washing facilities are not available.</p>

<p>There should be signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into the crook of your sleeved arm if a tissue is not available.</p>

<p>You should provide hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to toilet facilities.</p>

<h2 id="toilets">Toilets</h2>

<p>Toilets inside or linked to places of worship should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Steps that will usually be needed to make the use of toilets as safe as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using signs and posters (see Hygiene above)</li>
  <li>using social distancing marking in areas where queues may form, and the adoption of a limited entry approach, with one in, one out (whilst avoiding the creation of additional bottlenecks)</li>
  <li>to enable good hand-hygiene make hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical. And ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand dryers) are available. Communal towels should be removed and replaced with single use paper towels.</li>
  <li>set clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider the use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces</li>
  <li>keep the facilities well ventilated, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate and safe to do so</li>
  <li>special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks</li>
  <li>putting up a visible cleaning schedule that is kept up to date</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent refuse collection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning</h2>

<p>All surfaces, especially those most frequently touched such as door handles and rails, should be regularly cleaned using standard cleaning products. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>. Sufficient time needs to be allowed for this cleaning to take place, particularly before reopening for the first time or between different types of permitted activities (see Table 1). Frequently used objects, surfaces or spaces, including for example doorways between outside and inside spaces should be given particular attention when cleaning.</p>

<p>Historic England has also produced <a rel="external" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/coronavirus/historic-places/cleaning-historic-surfaces/" class="govuk-link">guidance on cleaning historic surfaces</a>, which might not be suitable for cleaning using standard cleaning products.</p>

<p>A decision should be made locally on how frequently cleaning should take place based on an assessment of risk and use of the building.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste#cleaning-waste" class="govuk-link">guidance on waste disposal in non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-the-vulnerable">Protecting the vulnerable</h2>

<p>There should be a particular focus on protecting people who are clinically vulnerable and more likely to develop severe illness, including people who are aged 70 or older, regardless of medical conditions.</p>

<p>Individuals who fall within this group are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if they do go out, to take particular care not to interact with people outside of their own household.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-places-of-worship-communicate-this-guidance-to-visitors">How can places of worship communicate this guidance to visitors?</h2>

<p>Each place of worship is strongly advised to put the measures set out in this guidance in place to ensure that visitors follow government’s guidance, and any risk assessments advised, are completed for the venue, for the safety of all those who visit and work there.</p>

<p>Many faiths have issued specific guidance to their faith communities about some of these issues. You may wish to make the government’s information on COVID-19 available to your faith community and others, in order to challenge misinformation.</p>

<p>Places of worship and faith leaders should consider how guidance can be communicated to visitors, including before they visit, in a way that is accessible and appropriate for the cultures, languages and reading levels of communities served by the place of worship.</p>

<h2 id="guidance-for-early-years-and-childcare-use">Guidance for early years and childcare use</h2>

<p>During the period of new national restrictions from 5 November, out-of-school settings (including wraparound childcare) can continue to operate if it is primarily for the purpose of enabling parents to work or other essential purposes as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-and-childcare-settings-new-national-restrictions-from-5-november-2020#ooss" class="govuk-link">guidance for education and childcare settings: new national restrictions from 5 November 2020.</a></p>

<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>It is important to be aware of the enforcement provisions, as is the case for other sectors.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority (usually your local authority), identifies responsible individuals who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks (including this guidance), they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure social distancing, where possible.</p>

<p>Under existing <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm" class="govuk-link">Health &amp; Safety legislation</a>, failure to complete a risk assessment that accounts for COVID-19 could constitute a breach of that legislation, as could having a risk assessment with insufficient measure.</p>

<p>The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to employers to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Serious breaches and failure to comply with enforcement notices are against the law with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to respond to such actions or any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authority. The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against COVID-19 by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<h2 id="annex-template-form-for-collecting-consent-and-contact-details-for-attendees-at-places-of-worship">Annex: Template form for collecting consent and contact details for attendees at places of worship</h2>

<p>In order to support the NHS Test and Trace programme, we are taking contact details (name and telephone number) for all visitors, as well as recording times entering and leaving [name of place of worship].</p>

<p>In line with guidance issued by the Department for Health and Social Care, we will keep your details safely and in compliance with GDPR legislation for 21 days before securely disposing of or deleting them. We will only share your details with NHS Test and Trace, if asked, in the event that it is needed to help stop the spread of coronavirus. We will not use your details for any other purposes or pass them on to anyone else.</p>

The vast majority of employers are responsible and will join with the UK’s fight against COVID-19 by working with the Government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>"
