<p>This guidance applies to England, except for where local restrictions apply. See GOV.UK for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">list of local restrictions</a>.</p>

<p>On 23 March 2020, the government required by law that certain businesses and venues were to close in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Most businesses and venues are now allowed to open, following COVID-19 Secure guidelines, as part of the governmentâ€™s plan to return life to as near normal as we can, with only a small number required to remain closed.</p>

<p>On 22 September, the government announced additional measures to address an increase in coronavirus cases. See Section 1 for the increased restrictions in the hospitality and leisure industry, which are in force from 24 September.</p>

<p>Whether indoors or outdoors people from different households must not meet in groups of larger than 6. This limit does not apply to meetings of a single household group or support bubble which is more than 6 people.</p>

<p>Venues following COVID-19 secure guidelines can host more than 6 people in total, but no one should visit or socialise in a group of greater than 6, unless they are from the same household or support bubble. See <a href="#social-contact" class="govuk-link">further information in section 5</a>, including links to relevant guidance on exemptions.</p>

<p>These are in addition to wider social contact rules: for more information on those, please refer to GOV.UK guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">staying alert and safe</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-outbreak-faqs-what-you-can-and-cant-do" class="govuk-link">frequently asked questions</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">meeting with others safely</a>.</p>

  <li>Keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested.</li>
  <li>Display an official NHS QR code poster from 24 September 2020, so that customers and visitors can â€˜check inâ€™ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details.</li>
  <li>Adhere to General Data Protection Regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties. It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<p>Designated venues will need to keep records of customers, visitors and staff for a period of 21 days and make them available when requested by NHS Test and Trace or local public health officials to help contain clusters or outbreaks.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">find out more about these requirements here</a></p>

<h2 id="social-contact">
<span class="number">5. </span> Social contact</h2>

<p>To prevent the spread of the virus, from 14 September there will be legal limits on how many people someone can spend time within a group at any one time. Whether indoors or outdoors people from different households must not meet in groups of larger than 6. This limit does not apply to meetings of a single household group or support bubble which is more than 6 people.</p>

<p>Venues following COVID-19 secure guidelines can host more than 6 people in total, in line with guidance for their sector, but no one should visit or socialise in a group of greater than 6 (unless they are all part of the same household or support bubble). It is also important that people from different households (who are not meeting as a support bubble) remain socially distanced. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">Further information on social contact rules, social distancing and the exemptions that exist</a> can be found here. These rules will not apply to workplaces or education settings, alongside other exemptions.</p>

<p>Businesses should demonstrate to their workers and attendees that they have properly assessed their risk and taken appropriate measures to mitigate it, for example by publishing their risk assessment online or making it available at the premises/event.</p>

<p>In particular, those operating venues or running events following COVID-19 Secure guidelines should take additional steps to ensure the safety of the public and prevent large gatherings or mass events from taking place.</p>

<p>Individual businesses or venues should also consider the cumulative impact of many venues reopening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations.</p>

<p>These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advising patrons to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities should avoid issuing licenses for events that could lead to larger gatherings forming and provide advice to businesses on how to manage events of this type. If appropriate, both local authorities and the Government have powers to close venues, to restrict access to public outdoor spaces, or to cancel events.</p>

<p>The Police have the powers to issue a Â£10,000 fixed penalty notice to anyone holding, or involved in the holding, of an illegal gathering of over 30 people.</p>

<h2 id="compliance">
<span class="number">6. </span> Compliance</h2>

<p>As of 26 March 2020, Regulations (which have now been replaced with consolidated Regulations to take account of the gradual relaxation of restrictions) imposed enforceable restrictions on people in England. The Regulations are reviewed regularly to ensure they are effective and proportionate to the risk to public health. The most recent and up to date England Regulations can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/684/made" class="govuk-link">legislation website</a>. Everyone is required to comply with these Regulations issued by the government in relation to coronavirus, in order to protect both themselves and others, to fail to do so can constitute a criminal offence.</p>

<p>An owner, proprietor or manager carrying out a business (or a person responsible for other premises) who contravenes the Regulations, without reasonable excuse, commits an offence.</p>

<p>In England, Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will monitor compliance with these regulations, with police support provided if appropriate. Businesses and venues that breach restrictions will potentially be subject to prohibition notices, and a person who is 18 or over, who carries on a business in contravention of the Regulations may be issued with a fixed penalty.</p>

<p>With the support of the police, prohibition notices can be used to require compliance with the Regulations including requiring that an activity ceases. It is also an offence, without reasonable excuse, to fail to comply with a prohibition notice.</p>

<p>If prohibition notices are not complied with, or a fixed penalty notice not paid, you may also be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose potentially unlimited fines.</p>

<h2 id="closing-specific-premises-or-public-places">
<span class="number">7. </span> Closing specific premises or public places</h2>

<p>Both a local authority or the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care have the power to direct the closure of, or to restrict access to, a specific premises or public outdoor place where this is necessary and proportionate to manage a serious and imminent threat to public health relating to coronavirus in England. Exercise of this power is subject to a right of appeal by an owner or occupier to a Magistrates Court (or, if used by a local authority, through representations to the Secretary of State).</p>

<p>Where this power is used, people will not be allowed to enter or remain in the premises or outdoor place without reasonable excuse (such as that the person lives or works in the restricted area). Local authorities must advertise the extent of the restriction and they and owners/operators of the place subject to the restriction must take reasonable steps to restrict access of people visiting the area. Failure to comply can be a criminal offence.</p>

<h2 id="business-support">
<span class="number">8. </span> Business support</h2>

<p>In England, under the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant (RHLG) measures announced on Monday March 16, businesses and venues in England in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be eligible for cash grants of up to Â£25,000 per property.</p>

<p>Eligible businesses and venues in these sectors with a property that has a rateable value of up to Â£15,000 will receive a grant of Â£10,000. Eligible businesses and venues in these sectors with a property that has a rateable value of between Â£15,001 and Â£51,000 will receive a grant of Â£25,000. Businesses and venues with a rateable value of over Â£51,000 are not included in this scheme.</p>

<p>For more information please visit the governmentâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support" class="govuk-link">business support page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="business-rates">
<span class="number">9. </span> Business rates</h2>

<p>In England, as announced on Monday 16 March, the government will provide a business rates holiday for businesses and venues in the retail, hospitality and/or leisure sector. This includes the businesses and venues in scope for closure listed above. The relief will apply to business rates bills for the 2020 to 2021 tax year.</p>

<h2 id="face-coverings">
<span class="number">10. </span> Face coverings</h2>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">latest face covering guidance</a>.</p>

<p>From 23 September, there will be additional venues and areas where it will be mandatory to wear a face covering, unless you have an exemption.</p>

<p>From 24 September, staff in retail and hospitality settings will be required to wear a face covering and all businesses must remind customers to wear a face covering where mandated, such as by displaying posters.</p>

<h2 id="further-information">
<span class="number">11. </span> Further information</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated regularly as the situation develops and to reflect frequently asked questions.
