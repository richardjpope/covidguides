<p>We recognise that detailed guidance can be difficult to apply to unique situations, events or places. However, there are some key principles that should help us all make decisions that ensure we can all take part in special religious services and gatherings safely at this time.</p>

<p>Before attending a synagogue, or marking the festivals in other ways, you should check whether there are any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">geographic lockdown measures being introduced within your local area</a>.</p>

<h2 id="advice-on-symptoms-and-testing">
<span class="number">1. </span>Advice on symptoms and testing</h2>

<p>If you are unwell or have any of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">main symptoms of coronavirus</a> – a new continuous cough, a high temperature or loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – get a test immediately and stay at home where you, and members of your household, should isolate. Do not invite anyone to your house and do not leave home. You should not prepare food for others.</p>

<h2 id="at-home-with-family">
<span class="number">2. </span>At home/ with family</h2>

<p>When celebrating religious festivals, it is important to limit risks around the transmission of the virus. Those risks increase whenever households mix. A household means those people who usually live together under the same roof and share facilities with you. If you have family members who do not normally live with you, they need to be treated as a separate household.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is against the law to gather in a group of more than 6, indoors or outdoors, unless covered by an exemption.</li>
  <li>Gatherings comprising the members of only one household or support bubble are exempt - i.e. they can continue to gather both within and outside their home in a group larger than 6.</li>
  <li>Even in these groups you should ensure you wash your hands frequently and keep 2 metres apart from people outside your own household or bubble, even in your own home or other people’s homes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other actions taken to reduce the risk of transmission should also be considered, for example, any food should be pre-wrapped, should not be shared between groups, and you should ensure friends and family use their own dishes and cutlery.</p>

<h2 id="at-synagogue">
<span class="number">3. </span>At synagogue</h2>

<p>Communal worship or prayer can be attended by more than 6 people in total if they can accommodate larger numbers in a way which complies with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/offices-and-contact-centres" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 Secure guidance</a> but you must still socially distance from people you do not live with.</p>

<p>It is important that risks are managed sensibly. In line with wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july" class="govuk-link">Places of worship guidance</a> you should:</p>

<h3 id="for-those-organising-an-event">
<span class="number">3.1 </span>For those organising an event</h3>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Continue to broadcast services online where possible for those who need to stay at home or are able to mark join a service online to avoid large gatherings.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Remove communal resources such as prayer books. Encourage worshippers to bring their own books and take them away with them when they return home. Single use alternatives should be removed after use and disposed of by the worshipper.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Where this is allowed, speak into a microphone to lead devotions or sermons to avoid shouting. Avoid sharing microphones between different speakers.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Small groups of singers, including choirs, can perform in front of worshippers. Singing should be limited to a small set group of people and should not include audience participation. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">Performing arts guidance</a> outlines additional mitigations such as good ventilation and social distancing.</p>

<h3 id="for-those-attending-an-event">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>For those attending an event</h3>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Follow the mitigations that synagogues have put in place, for example using booking systems, changes to entrances and exits, or staggered arrivals.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Make sure you socially distance. This means 2 metres between households, or 1 metre with additional mitigations if 2 metres is not possible – such as wearing face masks or increasing the ventilation in the room.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> interact socially outside of your household, or the group (of no more than 5 other people) that you attended to the place of worship with.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Wear a face covering, unless you are exempt – you must wear these if you travel on public transport or visit a shop and are advised to wear them in enclosed spaces where you are with other people you do not normally meet with.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Make sure you provide your contact details to the synagogue (potentially by booking online in advance) to support the NHS Test and Trace service designed to track and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, particularly before leaving the home and returning. If there are no hand washing facilities available use hand sanitiser.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Make sure only you touch your belongings, for example prayer books, or shoes if removed.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-outside">
<span class="number">4. </span>Gathering outside</h2>

<p>We know that prayers in the park and other outdoor spaces are an important feature of some festivals.</p>

<p>It is against the law in England to gather with more than 5 other people in private gardens. Gatherings in a public outdoor space are also against the law unless the gathering is exempt/ has been organised by a business, charity, a benevolent or philanthropic organisation or a public or political body applying COVID secure risk controls.</p>

<p>The organiser must have carried out a full risk assessment (there is advice on doing this in government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july" class="govuk-link">Places of worship guidance</a>) and taken all reasonable measures to limit the risk of transmission of coronavirus, including taking into account any relevant government guidance on gatherings.</p>

<p>Government guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close" class="govuk-link">Closing certain businesses and venues</a> sets out how gatherings can be made COVID-19 Secure.</p>

<p>Local authorities will make decisions on applications for prayers in public places, including those on private land which is not attached to your place of worship. Councils will be putting the public health and safety needs of communities first when making these decisions.</p>

<p>This year to make sure that people are not putting themselves at risk of contracting COVID-19, where possible you should avoid attending large gatherings.</p>

<h3 id="for-those-organising-an-event-1">
<span class="number">4.1 </span>For those organising an event</h3>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> The best way to make an event COVID-19 secure is for the community to actively work with the owner, the council, the local police and local partners. Those partners will have to carefully check that people can attend with minimal risk of transmitting COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> All events should follow social distancing guidance, and organisers should carry out risk assessments and apply the principles above.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> In public spaces (beyond the place of worship’s own grounds), you should work alongside the owner of that space and with other relevant authorities such as the local authority and police to put safety measures in place. You may want to do that even if on the grounds of a place of worship to manage other risks.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Consider how attendees will travel to your event. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">guidance for different modes of transport</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Keep numbers attending as low as possible regardless of the legal cap on numbers. The risks of transmission reduce the smaller the size of the gathering.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Most importantly – if you are any doubt that risks can be managed effectively, then find a safer way to host your event.</p>

<h3 id="for-those-attending-an-event-1">
<span class="number">4.2 </span>For those attending an event</h3>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> join in with any large gatherings in outdoor spaces which do not have safety measures in place.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> mix in groups of more than 6, other than socialise with people you live with (or are in a support bubble with).</p>

<p><strong>Don’t</strong> risk your health by attending an event that hasn’t been approved by your council and the landowner.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong>If you choose to attend any gathering, you should ensure that it is COVID-19 secure and that you follow the safety advice set out by event organisers.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> It’s also important that you do not stay long after prayers/worship and you should not hug or touch anyone outside your household.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> You should provide your contact details to the organiser to support the NHS Test and Trace service designed to track and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> You should ensure that any celebrations held after prayers/worship only involve up to 6 people. You should also keep 2 metres apart from others at any celebration, even if you are in someone’s house.</p>

<h2 id="shofar-blowing">
<span class="number">5. </span>Shofar blowing</h2>

<p>We know that hearing the shofar being blown is an important part of the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services. In order for this to happen safely this year, additional safeguards should be put in place to reduce the possibilities of spreading the virus.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> The shofar should only be handled by the person blowing the shofar. Where possible they should bring their own shofar and take it home with them after the service.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If more than one person needs to touch the shofar, hands should be thoroughly washed before and after the exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> The shofar blower should maintain 2 metres distance from other worshippers.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> Under no circumstances should more than one person blow the same shofar.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> The shofar should not be blown towards worshippers.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If shofar blowing events are arranged to facilitate more people being able to hear the shofar outside of services, they should follow the same guidelines for <a href="#gathering-outside" class="govuk-link">Gathering outside</a> listed above.</p>

<h2 id="tashlich">
<span class="number">6. </span>Tashlich</h2>

<p>For those who want to participate in tashlich rituals, extra care should be taken to limit the risks of transmission.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> There should be no more than 6 people to perform tashlich unless your household or support bubble is larger than 6 people. Where that is the case, your entire household or bubble can participate, but no additional people can join you, this is against the law.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong>You must maintain social distancing of 2 metres, or 1 metre with additional mitigations if this is not possible, from people outside of your household.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> You should not share any items to be used in the ceremony, such as prayer books or breadcrumbs.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If events are arranged to facilitate more people being able to perform tashlich, they should follow the same guidelines for <a href="#gathering-outside" class="govuk-link">Gathering outside</a> listed above.</p>

<h2 id="sukkot-and-shemini-atzeretsimchat-torah">
<span class="number">7. </span>Sukkot and Shemini Atzeret/Simchat Torah</h2>

<p>We know that there is a particular tradition of hospitality associated with Sukkot and recognise that it will be upsetting not to share this time with family and friends. However, we must all adapt our usual practices in order to limit the risks of transmitting the virus and keep our loved ones safe.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If you are building a sukkah in your own garden, there should be no more than 6 people in your garden or home at any time. If your household or support bubble is larger than 6 people, your entire household or bubble can be in the sukkah but no additional people can join you.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Even in these groups of 6 you should ensure you wash your hands frequently and keep 2 metres apart from people outside your own household or bubble, even in other people’s homes or Sukkot.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Other actions taken to reduce the risk of transmission should also be considered, for example, sharing of food between households or support bubbles should be avoided – any should be pre-wrapped, and members of different households should ensure friends and family use their own dishes and cutlery.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Family visits should follow the social distancing rules, keeping 2 metres apart between different households outdoors or indoors.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If a synagogue is erecting a communal sukkah on their own grounds, it should be treated as a part of the synagogue. It can be used for prayer services but COVID-19 Secure measures should be put in place, including ensuring the numbers attending can be safely accommodated while adhering to social distancing, and face coverings should be worn etc.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> Social gatherings in a communal sukkah, or “sukkah crawls” across different members of the community, should not take place at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> Sets of Arba Minim (Lulav and Etrog) should not be shared between households.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If you wish to shake the Arba Minim at synagogue, you should bring your own set with you and take it home with you after the service. You should ensure your belongings are clearly marked so as not to be confused with other people’s.</p>

<p><strong>Do –</strong> If hoshanot or hakafot are taking place, care should be taken to ensure social distancing is maintained at all times, and face coverings should be worn.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> Torah scrolls should not be handled by more people than is strictly necessary, and hands should be thoroughly washed before and after any exchanges.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t –</strong> Dancing should not take place.</p>

<p>We know this might be disappointing but it’s important to remember that the virus is still with us and we need to do all we can to protect ourselves and our family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>These restrictions and guidance are in place to keep all of our families, friends and communities safe during this time and we recognise that festivals will be marked differently throughout this pandemic.</strong></p>

You may want to do that even if on the grounds of a place of worship to manage other risks.</p><p><strong>Do –</strong> Consider how attendees will travel to your event.
