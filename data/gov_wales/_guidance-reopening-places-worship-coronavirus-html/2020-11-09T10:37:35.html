            <div><p>This guidance has been written specifically with places of worship and gatherings of faith and belief groups in mind. It is of a general nature and should be considered alongside other specific guidance to ensure that places of worship can offer COVID-19 secure environments.  It aims to provide useful information, links and practical advice to support those responsible for reopening places of worship (should they wish) for communal worship and religious ceremonies in accordance with Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 4) (Wales) Regulations 2020, which have allowed places of worship to reopen, following the requirement for them to close during the firebreak which finished at the end of the day on 8 November 2020.</p>

<p>Should any doubt arise between provisions in this guidance, and the statutory guidance issued by the Welsh Ministers the statutory guidance shall prevail.  Additionally, this guidance does not constitute legal advice, those responsible for places of worship should seek their own independent legal advice where necessary.</p>

<p>Each individual place of worship should consider this guidance within the context of its own specific circumstances, including consideration of the size of the building, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated. This guidance does not impose a duty or requirement on places of worship to open. The persons responsible for the place of worship will have the freedom to decide when they consider it is safe to reopen. They should remain closed if they are not satisfied they are able to take <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus, as required under regulation 12.</p>

<p>Some places of worship may choose not to reopen until a later date, open at a slower pace and/or continue to use online technology to carry out faith and pastoral activities. In managing risk the first question should always be can I avoid the risky activity. Wherever practical and reasonable, alternatives to face to face meeting should be employed to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government is grateful to the Wales Faith Communities Forum and the Re-opening Places of Worship Task and Finish group for their advice and support in preparing this guidance. The Welsh Government will continue to work with the Wales Faith Communities Forum and belief groups to develop and plan for a phased and safe reopening of places of worship and the organisation of outdoor gatherings. This guidance will be reviewed and amended as the situation and scientific advice around risks of transmission changes and further amendments to the Regulations made. </p></div>

<p>The Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 4) (Wales) Regulations 2020 impose temporary restrictions on gatherings and movement of people into and out of Wales. This has been done to control the spread of coronavirus in Wales and to help protect the public from the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). </p>

            <div><p>The term “place of worship” is not defined in the Regulations.  For the purposes of this guidance, the term includes a confined or enclosed space, within buildings or outdoors, which is used for religious or belief ceremonies, collective prayer and worship or similar gatherings, such as a church, gurdwara, mosque, temple, synagogue, prayer rooms, meeting houses, vestries and halls where worship may be carried out. This can include buildings or rooms which are not exclusively used as a place of worship. For example, community centres, halls or venues hired by a religious or belief body for the purpose.  </p>

<p>In this guidance, the term a “religious or belief body” refers to an organised group of people who regularly meet for religious worship or to uphold and      promote philosophical beliefs and meet regularly for the purpose.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this guidance, the term “worshippers” is used to describe individuals or members of individual households who engage in a permitted activity. The same definition also applies to participants who engage as part of their non-religious belief structure.  </p>

<p>Worship includes gatherings for religious and belief ceremonies including funerals, the solemnisation of marriages, and the formation of civil partnerships, baptisms (see further advice below) and other ceremonies that celebrate rites of passage. These may be part of a communal services or an event in their own right.</p>

<p>Religious ceremonies can be held as part of communal worship or as an event in their own right, such as a funeral or wedding, such ceremonies that do not form part of communal worship should continue to be by invitation only as described in the guidance for <a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-local-authorities-funerals-covid-19">funerals</a> and <a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-marriages-and-civil-partnerships-coronavirus">weddings</a>.</p>

<p>Worship and belief ceremonies can be held outdoors in the limited circumstances described in this guidance.</p>

<p>Places of worship and faith and belief communities should adapt their services and ceremonies, especially where they would otherwise have taken place over a number of hours or days, to ensure the safety of those present and minimise the spread of infection.</p>

<p>Once completed, participants should be encouraged to leave the premises promptly and to maintain 2 metres distance from members of other households, to minimise the risk of contact and spread of infection.  The rules on gathering allow attendance at a place of worship as a reasonable excuse, however that should not be for a social purpose. If appropriate, you should reconfigure spaces to enable those in attendance to be seated rather than standing which reduces the risk of contact.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, where possible, places of worship continue to broadcast worship or other events to avoid large gatherings and to continue to reach those individuals who are <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolating</a> or <a href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">vulnerable</a> to COVID-19.</p></div>

              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div><p>We recognise the importance of music, singing and chanting in worship, religious and belief ceremonies. However, there are significant risks associated with playing wind instruments and with singing or chanting at louder volumes. The risks are associated with the increased spread of droplets or aerosol which rise alongside volume. For this reason activities such as congregational singing, chanting, or shouting should be specifically avoided indoors.</p>

<p>It is possible for an organised group or groups of musicians or singers to play a part in worship, but a specific risk assessment and mitigating actions should be put in place to provide a Covid-19 safe environment. Singing or playing in groups should be limited in line with the capacity of the space given appropriate physical distancing requirements.</p>

<p>If singing or the playing of music is to happen it should be accompanied by clear messages that those not in an organised group of musicians or singers should not join in. Organised singing can be facilitated by establishing fixed groups of up to six  people who can remain consistent and rehearse and perform together, whilst generally maintaining physical distancing amongst themselves.  . These groups should prepare for participation in worship by ensuring they understand the importance of keeping volumes low. Only where physical distancing and other mitigations allow, a fixed team of six may perform with other fixed teams to create a larger group but action should be taken to create barriers to transmission between the fixed teams. This approach recognises that for organised groups interaction will be necessary outside the context of the act of worship (for example in rehearsal) and consistent teams of six will allow the whole team to isolate themselves should a positive Covid-19  test necessitate this. In this way, the mitigations that will still be necessary to reduce the chance of transmission to a congregation, will be more effective. If the physical distancing and other mitigations cannot be achieved in this circumstance, a larger group of this kind cannot be formed.  All performers should be instructed in the use of planned mitigating actions and reminded of the role of volume in increasing transmission risk both for themselves and in creating a risk that congregations will sing, shout or chant at volume alongside the performance.  </p>

<p>The number of children aged under 11 who can gather  outside the home is not limited in law. However, as young children can still transmit the virus, they should be encouraged to follow hand hygiene measures and keep close contact to a minimum wherever possible. Even with children it is safer to meet in smaller numbers, and to meet the same people regularly rather than a range of different people. Therefore the number of children under 11 in an organised groups should be kept as low as possible.</p>

<p>In some cases congregations might be small and could be accommodated as a single organised group. This is permissible but the same requirements for preparation to sing at low volumes and mitigating actions, including collective exclusion from performing if a positive test is received in the group. Where, all the participants in worship are part of an organised singing group the number should not exceed six. It would not be appropriate for larger congregations to utilise the ability to add fixed groups together to circumvent the restrictions on gatherings.  It is important that places of worship ensure that  they maintain a barrier to transmission by making sure that singers are well prepared to sing safely. No gathering of these groups of  six should exceed 15 indoors or 30 outdoors except where the performers are all professional. All rehearsal and performance should be based on a risk assessment. </p>

<p>Specific risk assessments for organised groups who are singing or playing musical instruments should consider;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Physical distancing between individuals</li>
	<li>Physical distancing between fixed groups</li>
	<li>Physical distancing between performers and congregations</li>
	<li>The size and layout of the space</li>
	<li>The ventilation available to prevent the accumulation of aerosol.</li>
	<li>The use of screens or other barriers between individuals and fixed groups</li>
	<li>The positioning of singers and instrumentalists to favour back to back or side to side and reduce face to face performance.</li>
	<li>Performing outdoors </li>
	<li>Reference should be made to the <a href="/node/32847#section-50444">guidance on performing arts,</a> which deals with safe performance for singers, musicians and other performers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wind instruments should not be played indoors. The decision whether to play an organ that requires air to be pushed through the mechanism should be based on a specific risk assessment and adherence with hand hygiene and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning guidance</a> and physical distancing, for example from the remainder of the congregation and avoiding use of a registrant. It is advised that you use alternative instruments such as a piano, electronic instruments or recordings.</p>

<p>This guidance relates to musicians playing as part of worship. Other circumstances, such as concerts given to the public should follow the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a2be1f76-8403-4689-97ca-f8b9bd2c760f" href="https://gov.wales/rehearsing-performing-and-taking-part-performing-arts-guidance-phased-return-html#section-50444">guidance made available to the performing arts sector</a>. </p>

<p>Music should not be played at levels that make normal conversations difficult. This is because raised voices or shouting significantly increase the risk of transmission through aerosol and droplets.  Where a band or recorded music is playing it is advisable to stress to those in attendance the importance of avoiding singing and organisers should consider the impact of the volume or sustained length of music on the likelihood that people will converse with raised voices.  </p>

<p>Congregational singing should not occur indoors. If appropriate worshippers can read hymns, songs, prayers or other texts in a lowered voice.  Spoken responses should also be made quietly.  </p>

<p>Singing and playing music outdoors is permissible, although in order for more than four people to gather outdoors this must be at an organised activity, limited to 30 people.  Any such activity will be subject to a risk assessment and the organiser must take reasonable measures to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus (more information is included in the section on Worship Outdoors below). Such gatherings should maintain physical distancing between households and volumes kept low wherever possible.</p>

<p>Ringing of bells, or similar, may take place. However, people attending to peal bells should be included in the risk assessment process and subsequent protocols for attendance at the event. Specific provisions should be made where circumstances allow, such as separate entrances, and physical distancing measures between bell ringers and hand hygiene while pealing the bells and between them and the other attendees.</p></div>

            <div><p>Whilst physical distancing is an important part of preventing transmission of Coronavirus it is not enough alone to prevent all forms of airborne transmission. There is a growing body of evidence of the role that transmission by aerosol is playing in spreading the virus. Aerosol is the fine mist (as opposed to larger droplets) containing infectious particles that an infected person exhales. Without ventilation, this aerosol can concentrate in indoor areas. Two factors are key to this concentration, one is the rate at which aerosol is emitted and the other is time over which the activity takes place. Emissions are significantly affected by the volume at which an infected person might sing or speak. Evidence suggests that we emit 50 times more virus laden particles when we speak in a loud voice than when we don’t speak at all.</p>

<p>These emissions will remain airborne in aerosol and concentrate over time. Face coverings will reduce but not eradicate the emission of infected aerosol so the longer the period spend together with an infected person in a poorly ventilated space the more the risk of transmission increases.</p>

<p>Planning for good ventilation should therefore form part of an effective risk assessment. Reducing the time over which an activity takes place as well as mechanical ventilation and utilising natural ventilation such as keeping doors and windows open are all mitigations to manage the risk posed by aerosol in places of worshipIt is recognised that weather can make natural ventilation uncomfortable and as winter approaches the need for ventilation remains an important strategy for reducing our risk of exposure to the virus.  It will be important to maximise airflow through the use of vents, windows and doors whilst maintaining a comfortable indoor environment.  Opening windows/doors for at least five minutes before worshippers arrive and when everyone has gone home, and again between services if there is more than one scheduled will allow air to circulate.  If at all possible, open all windows/doors for a few minutes in the day to allow for cross ventilation – that is for stale air to flow out and fresh air to come in.</p>

<p>However, in managing the transmission of the virus during the pandemic it might be appropriate to ask worshippers to dress so that windows and doors can be kept open. Where it is not possible to maximise natural ventilation places of worship should consider shortening activities held indoors.</p>

<p>Natural ventilation via windows, doors or vents should therefore be used as far as possible. Where centralised or mechanical ventilation is present, re-circulatory systems should be adjusted to full fresh air, if this is not possible systems can be operated as normal, but should be supported by natural ventilation to avoid recirculating infected air. Where ventilation units have filters present ensure enhanced precautions are taken when changing filters.</p>

            <div><p>The distribution of food or drink (consumables) should be avoided except where they are integral to the worship or religious or belief ceremony.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to handle consumables during a ceremony then those giving and receiving the item should wash their hands before and after exchange and avoid contact. Where possible a distance of 2 metres should be maintained.  Utensils must not be shared between people.</p>

<p>In circumstances when it is not possible to maintain a 2 metre distance the person distributing the consumable should release it into the hand only, in such a way as to avoid any contact between them and those receiving it. If accidental contact does occur, both people should cleanse their hands immediately.</p>

<p>Other mitigations should also be considered, for example, foodstuffs should be prewrapped, and a system should be in place to prevent individuals from coming into contact with consumables and any dishes and/ or cutlery other than their own (for example bowls or cups should not be shared). Consumables should only be shared within household groups. Wherever possible ceremonial consumables should not be consumed at the time but taken away for later.</p>

<p>Speaking, singing and chanting should not happen across uncovered consumables (other than consumables to be used by the individual alone). Instead consumables should be securely covered, and prior to the receptacle being opened, surfaces should be cleaned, hands must be washed or gloves worn.</p>

<p>Preparation of foodstuffs may take place on the premises, but where it does, <a href="https://gov.wales/tourism-and-hospitality-businesses-guidance-phased-reopening">relevant guidance</a> and <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing measures</a> should be observed.</p>

<p>If hand washing with soap and water is not practical, hand sanitisers should be used.</p>

<p>Any pre-requisite washing/ablution rituals should not be done at the place of worship but carried out prior to arrival.</p>

To comply with physical distancing guidance, baptisms should be by self-immersion (Self-immersion means only the candidate should be in the baptistery or pool and not touched by anyone unless they are from the same household) and no one should be baptised by another person, with exception of a member of their own household. Anyone else present should stay out of range of any potential splashing. A self – immersion baptism, in a safe external space designated for swimming such as a lido or beach that is patrolled by lifeguards would be allowed,</p></div>

<p>Up to a maximum of 30 individuals are permitted to gather outdoors. Those who organise an event will have a duty of care to those attending to make it as safe as possible. The Welsh Government is keen to ensure that  a risk assessment on the outdoor space comparable to one required under regulation 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 is carried out and that all reasonable measures are taken to <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">minimise risk to exposure</a> of coronavirus. The organiser should be able to control the outdoor space to maintain this COVID-19 security which means organisers should have exclusive use of the space for the duration of the event. Fences, signage and the use of representatives of the religious or belief body to manage access to the site may all be appropriate mechanisms to establish control of the space.</p>

<p>Control of the site may be established through ownership or with landowner’s permission. Organisers should be wary of circumstances which would undermine their control such as public rights of way across the site.</p>

<p>Liaison with Local Authorities and other authorities such as the Police may be necessary where land that is normally open to the public is to be used. The organiser should make sure that they communicate a clear understanding of the behaviours expected by those who attend. Where behaviours breach the protocols and risk the COVID-19 -security of the event, organisers should consider terminating the event or asking parties to leave. The organisers are responsible for managing the public health risks associated with the event.</p>

<p>Enclosed or partially enclosed spaces, as defined within the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a195a0e8-4ea9-4fb1-8826-66f06cfb87d3" href="https://gov.wales/smoking-ban-guide-business">Smoke Free Regulations</a> should not be erected for outdoor worship or religious or belief ceremonies as these will increase the opportunities for the virus to spread. It is possible to use an awning or marquee which is open on at least three sides or a ‘gazebo’ which is open on all sides to provide protection from the weather. However, this should not undermine the COVID-19 security of the site.</p>

<p>The numbers attending outdoor worship or religious or belief ceremonies should be determined by the risk assessment but must not exceed 30 individuals. Attendance need not be by invitation only although organisers may choose to put procedures in place to manage attendance. The organiser is responsible for ensuring that capacity is not exceeded and may need to turn people away to maintain this. Where the service or ceremony relates to a life event, such as a wedding celebration, the organiser should ensure attendance is by invitation. This is because these events are often attended by people who would not normally attend places of worship and anticipating numbers may be more difficult.</p>

<p>Events that may be organised to include vehicles are included in this concept of outdoor worship or religious or belief ceremonies and the risk assessment should reflect this, ensuring that cars maintain household separation.</p></div>

Those responsible for places of worship that belong to a denomination or grouping at regional or national level should contact their representative body for further guidance.</p>

<p>This risk assessment should take place in addition to any risk or health and safety assessments already in place. The risk assessment should be done in consultation with unions or workers (including volunteers and contractors) as relevant. It may also be beneficial to include worshippers or other stakeholders in this process.</p>

<p>As the number and variety of activities within the place of worship increases, independent risk assessment should be prepared for the different uses. Careful consideration should be given to whether it is practical to allow different uses to happen concurrently and to ensure that the arrangements put in place for one use does not undermine the COVID-19 secure environment being created by the other arrangements.</p>

<p>You should consider using the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebd839ac-7231-499b-a332-82f1084c6cf4" href="/node/30493">COVID-19 Workforce Risk Assessment Tool </a>with all staff and volunteers to ensure that personal risk to these personnel is mitigated.</p></div>

<p>Drinking Water Inspectorate’s guidance on bringing buildings back into use after a period of disuse may be helpful. The guidance covers a range of quality issues that should be considered. The guidance is available on the <a href="http://www.dwi.gov.uk/index.htm">DWIs general web page.</a></p>

<p>In order to ensure good practice is adhered to by those attending, including hand and respiratory hygiene, those managing the building may wish to consider introducing some or all of the following measures as appropriate:</p>

<ul>
	<li>taking the necessary actions to mitigate any risks identified in any risk assessment</li>
	<li>informing your worshippers of the changes introduced and when the building will be available</li>
	<li>using a notification or organised process to manage attendance at the place of worship or outdoor worship such as asking people to notify you of their intention to attend</li>
	<li>working with other places of worship to stagger opening times to reduce the pressure on one building</li>
	<li>deciding whether you will need people to manage the entrances, exits and the main body of the building when it is open</li>
	<li>taking measures to avoid people congregating in confined spaces, such as  introducing a one-way-system within the building identifying separate entry and exit points and systems to  manage people who are waiting to enter the building such as a 2 metre physically distanced queuing system</li>
	<li>making sure that any changes  take into account reasonable adjustments to accommodate those who need them, such as disabled worshippers</li>
	<li>ensuring that access to the building is not determined or prioritised by gender</li>
	<li>closing off unused areas, removing non-essential furniture, displays, play equipment, literature etc. from the areas that are open to worshippers</li>
	<li>to avoid sharing  articles such as prayer mats, hymn books and  religious texts and individuals should be encouraged to bring their own where relevant. These should be removed by the individual and not left in the place of worship</li>
	<li>using barriers or screens or other rooms to separate worshippers and different activities</li>
	<li>introduce signage and floor markings to guide worshippers. <a href="///D:/Users/pollardl/Objective/Objects/e%20https:/gov.wales/safety-and-physical-distancing-signs-employers-coronavirus">Display posters</a> to build awareness of social distancing and good hand hygiene</li>

<p>Additionally, separate guidance states that, whilst the rules on children under 11 having to maintain physical distancing has been relaxed, this age group must still observe the social restrictions on meeting others indoors who are not part of their household, and the maximum number of 30 people permitted to gather outside. Everyone should practise good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>The number who can attend at one time will depend on the size and the layout of the building. The legal requirement is that all reasonable measures are taken to ensure a distance of 2 metres is kept between those attending. For the purposes of this guidance attendees should maintain 2 metre distance except where usual practices require less than 2 metres is maintained and practices cannot be reasonably adapted. This means a distance of 2 metres between members of different households, not necessarily between each individual person (as members of the same household can safely sit together, this would include a carer and the person assisted by the carer). In defining the number of people that can reasonably attend whilst still adhering to 2 metres distancing, the total floor space as well as likely pinch points and busy areas should be taken into account (e.g. entrances, exits, corridors, aisles) to calculate capacity within each place of worship. All possible actions should be taken to avoid queues and to ensure that those waiting to enter or leave a place of worship do not inadvertently gather.</p>

<p>The other elements of the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing guidance</a> such as hand washing and respiratory hygiene practices should also be followed.</p></div>

<p>No one should feel obligated to return to a place of worship, even if they have a volunteering role that they would normally fulfil. </p>

<p>Those wishing to attend a place of worship should consider how far they need to travel and how they will travel to and from the building safely. Members of the same household or extended household may travel together. Read the Welsh Government's <a href="https://gov.wales/travelling-safely-coronavirus-guidance-public">advice on travelling safely.</a></p>

However, it is encouraged that details are taken and kept where there is a possibility of people coming into close contact   for instance as part of a marriage, communion or baptism or spends a longer time on the premises. A record of the time and date of the event and the names and telephone contact should be kept and handled in accordance with GDPR to protect the individuals’ privacy. These records should be kept for 21 days after the event. read further guidance on <a href="https://gov.wales/keeping-records-staff-customers-and-visitors-test-trace-protect">how to maintain records and on compliance with GDPR</a>.</p>

<p>The Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 4) (Wales) Regulations 2020 requires <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open"><strong>reasonable measures</strong></a> to be taken to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus on premises open to the public and on any premises where work takes place, as well as to minimise the spread of coronavirus by those who have been on the premises</p>

<p>One reasonable measure is:</p>

<p>Collecting contact information from each person at the premises or, in relation to persons from the same household, from one of them, and retaining it for 21 days for the purpose of providing it to any of the following, upon their request</p>

<ul>
	<li>the Welsh Ministers,</li>
	<li>a contact tracer</li>
</ul>

<p>and taking reasonable measures to ensure that such contact information is   correct.</p>

<p>'Contact information', in relation to a person at the premises, means the person’s name and information sufficient to enable the person to be contacted, to inform them that they may have been exposed to coronavirus at the premises (including a telephone number and the date and time at which the person was at the premises).</p>

<p>Whether this measure is one that is “reasonable” and is, therefore, one that <strong>must</strong> be taken depends on the extent to which people who don’t know each other may interact on the premises and whether there is a risk of close interaction. More guidance <a href="https://gov.wales/keeping-records-staff-customers-and-visitors-test-trace-protect#section-46233">is provided here.</a></p>

<p>By adhering to these Regulations by undertaking <a href="https://gov.wales/node/29574"><strong>reasonable measures</strong></a> to maintain records of staff, customers and visitors, and sharing these with the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service when requested, you will help to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic (i.e. are not yet displaying <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123"><strong>symptoms</strong></a>). Containing outbreaks is crucial to reducing the spread of coronavirus, protecting the NHS in Wales and saving lives.

<p>As the range and frequency of activities increase, places of worship should carefully consider whether it is practical to allow different uses to happen concurrently. Independent risk assessments should be carried out for the different uses and appropriate arrangements should be put in place to ensure the arrangements for the one use does not undermine the COVID-19 secure environment being created for the other.
