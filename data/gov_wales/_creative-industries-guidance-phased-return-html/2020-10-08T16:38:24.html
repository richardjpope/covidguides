            <div><p>The creative industries has been one of the fastest growing parts of the Welsh economy for a number of years. The sector doesn’t just create jobs and wealth – it contributes to a strong national brand and helps to promote Wales and its culture and talent to the world. A creative society in its widest sense promotes well-being and a more inclusive society.</p>

<p>This document offers high-level guidance for organisations operating in the creative industries in Wales. </p>

<p>Emerging from lockdown successfully requires a vigorous approach to finding common solutions that control and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 as part of a collective effort towards managing risk. As the First Minister of Wales stated in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="464005d0-3f08-4adb-9fe6-e23e7f2ffa77" href="https://gov.wales/leading-wales-out-coronavirus-pandemic">Leading Wales out of the Coronavirus Pandemic – a framework for recovery</a>, relaxing the current lockdown should not cause further harm.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities, and it is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors and other people, as well as your employees. This guidance does not repeat the guidance already available, but signposts to that guidance and to specific advice for key sub-sectors.<br />
<br />
The Welsh Ministers must review the need for the requirements and restrictions in the Coronavirus Regulations every 21 days.  The latest evidence from the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and the advice of the Chief Medical Officer for Wales says while the first peak of infection has passed and rates continue to fall, it is still too early for a significant lifting of requirements or restrictions.</p>

<p>Even when the restrictions are lifted, you should only restart activities when you feel able to do so safely. It is also for each employer to decide when it is the appropriate time to return workers to work from the Coronavirus Government Job Retention (‘furlough’) scheme.</p>

<p>It is an expectation that each organisation will apply detailed and bespoke solutions that focus on safeguarding all workers and the public, and will give due consideration to the local communities in which they exist and operate. Plans should be proportionate, should be reviewed regularly, and must offer a careful, phased approach to resuming activity. Organisations should also focus on creating agile solutions that can be paused or rapidly reversed in the event of further COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>

<p>Public and worker confidence will be key in supporting a successful and commercially viable return to business, and therefore a careful, coherent process of emerging from lockdown is essential.</p>

<p>This guidance reflects a continuing conversation between Welsh Government and the sector, as outlined in the First Minister’s ‘Unlocking our Society and Economy’ roadmap.  The Welsh Government welcomes the opportunity to discuss the sector’s responses to this guidance, and to understand the individual challenges faced by sector partners.</p>

            <div><p>To tackle the spread of coronavirus, the Welsh Government introduced regulations (“<a href="https://gov.wales/health-protection-coronavirus-restrictions-wales-regulations-2020-amended">the Coronavirus Regulations</a>”) in March which imposed strict restrictions on gatherings, the movement of people and the operation of businesses, including closures in Wales. The Welsh Government is now following a cautious approach to easing this lockdown and re-opening work places.</p>

<p>This prioritises protecting people by controlling the spread of coronavirus now so that together we can build back better.</p>

<p>The framework for easing lockdown, including reopening businesses and workplaces was published in <a href="https://gov.wales/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-continuing-conversation">Unlocking our society and economy: continuing the conversation</a> where a Red-Amber-Green traffic light system defines the stages for how restrictions in different areas of life in Wales may be gradually eased and lifted.</p>

<p>In these difficult times the safety, health and wellbeing of everyone is of paramount importance to us. We have produced this guidance to help employers and employees in the creative industry sector understand what we believe is important and how everyone should approach the shared endeavour of safe work.</p>

<p>This guidance does not replace legislation and statutory guidance, nor should it be considered a substitute for legal advice, which employers and employees should consider obtaining where necessary.</p>

<p>We have published <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-regulations-guidance">guidance and a set of frequently asked questions</a> to support any amendments.</p></div>

            <div><p>It is a legal requirement that all reasonable actions will have been taken in order to minimise transmission of Coronavirus in the workplace. The Welsh Government has issued guidance on <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-maintain-physical-distancing-workplace">taking all reasonable measures to maintain physical distancing in the workplace</a>, and also <a href="https://gov.wales/workplace-guidance-employers-and-employees-covid19"><strong>guidance for employers and employees on keeping safe in the workplace</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The work place guidance will be an essential tool as you being to resume activity, and includes information on key issues such as risk assessment, communication, signage and arrangements for visitors.</p>

<p>All reasonable measures must be taken to maintain a two metre distance between individuals in the workplace. The guidance above will help when considering the measures needed to reduce infection transmission rates at work.  All activity should be consistent with the <a href="https://gov.wales/protect-yourself-others-coronavirus">Welsh Government’s guidance regarding health, social distancing and hygiene</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone working in the creative industries who has tested positive for COVID-19 must not work at their place of work, although they can work from home if they are able to.  Anyone who feels unwell and displays symptoms of Coronavirus, should immediately self-isolate (as well as their household), <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">follow the Welsh Government’s self-isolation guidelines, and apply for a Coronavirus test</a>.  This includes anyone who has:</p>

<ul>
	<li>any of the symptoms of new onset cough, raised temperature over 37.8 C or new onset anosmia (a loss of or change to sense of smell or taste) or</li>
	<li>been identified as a contact of a positive case of coronavirus and told to self-isolate for 14 days in case they are incubating the infection.  </li>

	<li><a href="https://gov.wales/symptoms-and-self-isolation-contact-tracing">Symptoms and self-isolation for contact tracing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should follow Welsh Government guidance should anyone in the workplace display symptoms of Coronavirus and isolate the person, make arrangements to remove them to their home or a clinical facility if needed, and arrange suitable decontamination of their work space and any other areas they may have accessed e.g. toilet area.</p>

<p>Those working in the creative industries that are deemed ‘<a href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people">extremely vulnerable</a>’ on medical grounds should continue to follow Welsh Government advice. This currently includes maintaining ‘<a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-shielding-and-protecting-people-defined-medical-grounds-extremely-vulnerable-coronavirus-0">shielding</a>’.</p>

<p>It is essential that good hygiene practices are in place in workplaces in the creative industries, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">that equipment is disinfected regularly</a>, and that it is made clear to employees that anyone who is symptomatic - or suspects they may have been exposed to the virus - does not come into work, or should work from home if that is possible.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government has published <a href="https://gov.wales/your-responsibilities-employer-coronavirus">guidance to help employers understand their responsibilities and to allow workplaces to operate as safely as possible</a> as well as <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-guidance-employers">guidance on employers' responsibilities to help with Coronavirus testing and contact tracing</a>.</p>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<p>The Welsh Government has published guidance on <a href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public"><strong>face coverings and Coronavirus</strong></a>. </p>

<h3>Keeping the workplace clean</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"><strong>Cleaning protocols</strong></a> should be put in place to limit Coronavirus transmission. It is advised that touch points (e.g. door handles, desks, specialist equipment) should be particular areas of focus for increased cleaning.</p>

<p>Frequent cleaning of work areas and equipment between uses, using your usual cleaning products, is advised. As is clearing workspaces and removing waste and belongings from work areas at the end of shifts.</p>

<p>To help everyone maintain good hygiene, consideration should be given to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensuring handwashing facilities that provide running water, automatic soap dispensers and paper towels;</li>
	<li>using signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and to cough or sneeze into your arm;</li>
	<li>providing regular reminders and signage to maintain hygiene standards;</li>
	<li>providing hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to washrooms;</li>
	<li>setting clear use and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"><strong>cleaning guidance</strong></a> for toilets, showers and changing facilities to ensure they are kept clean and social distancing is achieved as much as possible;</li>
	<li>enhancing cleaning for busy areas;</li>
	<li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection;</li>
	<li>replacing hand dryers with paper towels in handwashing facilities;</li>
	<li>minimising use of portable toilets;</li>
	<li>setting clear guidance on how to handle goods, merchandise and materials.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test, Trace, Protect </h3>

<p>Test, Trace, Protect is the Welsh Government’s strategy for testing the general public and tracing the spread of the coronavirus in Wales.  The strategy provides information on implementing an appropriate and thorough record-keeping system to support the Welsh Government’s Test, Trace, Protect strategy in terms of workers to ensure they can be traced, contacted, advised to self-isolate and tested accordingly for Coronavirus in the event of them working at the same time as an individual, or staff member, who has since tested positive for Coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Employers will need to ensure that workers are duly advised (verbally by phone, or via a website or on-line booking system) of the need and reasons under GDPR rules for their personal information to be retained, and the duration required, to support the Welsh Government’s Test, Trace, Protect strategy. </p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive has also produced a series of guidance documents that will be helpful to support safe working environments in the creative industries:</p>

            <div><p>Early engagement with the creative industries sector has been essential to understand when it might be safe and practical to resume activity. Working together, the sector is identifying a basic framework for a phased return guided by the Welsh Government’s <a href="https://gov.wales/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-continuing-conversation">‘Unlocking our Society and Economy’ roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Resuming activity in the creative industries can only be possible when permitted by the Coronavirus Regulations, and we suggest you give due consideration to relevant industry guidelines as well. A summary of the latest Coronavirus Regulations and accompanying guidelines and live links are provided in section 2. Information on industry guidance published and in development is also set out later in this section.</p>

<p>This guidance should also be considered in the context of other provisions in the Coronavirus Regulations, (such as those relating to <a href="https://gov.wales/coronovirus-travel">travel</a> and <a href="https://gov.wales/education-coronavirus">education and childcare</a>), and guidance in other areas of life where there are key interdependencies that will affect the way we move forward.</p>

<p>This document includes links to guidance produced by industry bodies at a UK level. These provide advice on the law as it applies in England. When using these resources to support activity in Wales it is essential that they considered in the context to the law as it applies in Wales and that you familiarise yourself with the Welsh Regulations. </p>

<p>The timing and extent of resuming activity will vary as we progress through the phases for moving out of lockdown. However, the message is clear: some activities - due to the limitations posed by physical distancing - lend themselves to resuming activity earlier than others. </p>

<p>The sections on ‘getting around’, exercise and working or running a business are also relevant for those organisations operating in the creative industries.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the roadmap, the sector has continued to develop a joined-up approach. This has culminated in the establishment of stakeholder groups for the following sub-sectors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>screen (Film and TV production)</li>
	<li>digital</li>
	<li>music</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Creative Wales team has sought the views of the Books Council of Wales on opportunities to resume activity and support recovery in the publishing sector.</p>

<p>For each specialist area, consideration has been given to developing an approach for a phased return to activity and opportunities that can be presented to the Welsh Government as part of each 21 day review. Many of the issues are shared across the sector. However, there are also a number of issues and challenges that are very specific to each of the areas identified.</p>

<p>The following section provides a summary of the current situation in Welsh Government’s four creative industries priority sectors, and work undertaken to develop guidance to support a safe and practical resuming of activity.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Current situation and key issues</h3>

<p>The Coronavirus Regulations do not specifically prohibit film and TV production.  However, measures introduced to minimise the spread of the virus in Wales to protect the NHS and save lives, <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">including physical distancing</a> rules, travel, closing of locations, hospitality etc. have made continuing activity difficult.  As we begin to emerge from lockdown and restrictions are eased cautiously, working practices will need to be adapted to ensure activity can restart in a safe and compliant manner.</p>

<p>To confirm, filming can continue in Wales providing there is full compliance with Welsh law. Appropriate Welsh Government COVID-related guidance documents  should also be followed.  This includes a legal obligation and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">guidance on taking all reasonable measures to maintain physical distancing in the workplace</a>, compliance with relevant industry guidelines for physical production and receipt of any permissions needed from the local authority and / or land owners in which filming would take place. </p>

<p>Any filming that cannot be done in accordance with guidance should be discussed with Creative Wales in the first instance.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government has been working closely with the screen sector to understand how different types of productions can comply with the physical distancing duty in place in Wales and support safe ways to return to work, and work is underway across the sector to develop guidance that will support safe return to production activity.  These will support the re-introduction of TV and film production activity in Wales that has the potential to operate in line with existing restrictions, together with supply chain activity such as post production and VFX.</p>

<p>Work is also underway to ensure training is available to provide workers and crew with the necessary skills to operate in the context of the Coronavirus Regulations.  These courses will help to ensure all those working in the screen industry, irrespective of their role, are aware of the risk of COVID-19 and how it is transmitted, and how to protect themselves, their co-workers and the working environment. This includes training on health and safety, mental health, observing the social distancing requirements and good hand hygiene practises, and changes to working practices.</p>

<p>In addition, consideration is being given to the issue of insurance and any action that should be taken to address this significant barrier to film and TV production.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government recognises that many businesses in the creative industry sector will operate around the UK, and that there are a number of differences in the laws across the UK that businesses will have to consider.  In response to this, further information on the issue of key worker status, travel, accommodation and physical distancing is set out below:</p>

<h3>Key (critical) worker status</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A key worker or critical worker is a worker who is considered to provide an essential service or whose work is critical to the Covid-19 response. The term does not have general application but is used in specific circumstances to recognise where a worker should have access to specific entitlements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The full list of key or critical workers in Wales can be found in the relevant WG guidance documents (links included above).  In the context of journalists and broadcast media, key (critical) workers are journalists and broadcasters covering coronavirus or providing public service broadcasting, to include those companies working for or on behalf of public service broadcasters.</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>

<p>Guidance on <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgov.wales%2Ftravelling-safely-during-coronavirus-pandemic-guidance-public-html&amp;data=02%7C01%7CMelanie.Kinsey%40gov.wales%7C260ed135fd814ee79eca08d82f130958%7Ca2cc36c592804ae78887d06dab89216b%7C0%7C0%7C637311106086342536&amp;sdata=%2BaaD7tbGv0uEBUk7opjR6wmZDa6C7FQKj%2FX9tF8ukN8%3D&amp;reserved=0">travelling safely</a> during the coronavirus pandemic is available on the Welsh Government website.</p>

<p>Before your arrival in the UK, you must complete a passenger locator form and you must present these details on your arrival in Wales. This applies to both visitors and UK residents. There are also countries and territories with no self-isolation period on a return to Wales, this list applies from 11 July 2020. Unless you have visited or made a transit stop (see '<a href="https://gov.wales/travellers-exempt-self-isolation-coronavirus-covid-19">Travellers exempt from self-isolation: coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>') in any other country or territory in the preceding 14 days, you will need to self‑isolate on your return to Wales.  The UK Government is keeping the conditions in these countries and territories under weekly review, so it is best to check the list on a regular basis.</p>

<p>There are also groups of people who are exempt, these are highlighted within the document, which currently include Film and TV cast and production crews.  If you do need to self isolate, information can also be found within '<a href="https://gov.wales/travellers-exempt-self-isolation-coronavirus-covid-19">Travellers exempt from self-isolation: coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>'.</p>

<h3><strong>Accommodation</strong></h3>

<p>The Welsh Government has introduced guidance to help <a href="https://gov.wales/tourism-and-hospitality-businesses-guidance-phased-reopening-html#section-45227">tourism and hospitality businesses</a> safely re-open during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This sets out a phased return to reopening, in line with a continued requirement to ensure that a 2 metre distance is maintained between anyone on the premises.</p>

<h3>Physical distancing</h3>

<p>Welsh law requires all reasonable measures to be taken to maintain physical distancing (staying 2m apart) while working. Welsh Government <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-maintain-physical-distancing-workplace">guidance</a> on this requirement acknowledges that ‘there are working environments where physical distancing is not possible – and in consequence there may be circumstances where few or even no reasonable measures can be taken. For example, in relation to the provision of public facing essential services (including operation and maintenance of Critical National Infrastructure), factory settings, construction sites, the provision of health and social care services and the production and distribution of food’. This isn’t an exhaustive list.</p>

<p>This means that for a drama production all reasonable measures must be taken to ensure physical distancing wherever possible e.g. smaller crew, changes to layout, use of technology and plot changes. However, work can continue despite there being some situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained e.g. hair and make-up, key scenes essential to integrity of the plot. If possible other measures should be introduced to mitigate risks associated with close physical presence e.g. increased hygiene measures and provision of adequate supplies of hygiene products (automatic soap dispensers, paper tissues instead of towels, hand sanitisers etc.), use of personal protective equipment where possible and practical to do so (e.g. <a href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions">face coverings</a>), testing of relevant cast and crew, minimising the time spent where physical distance cannot be maintained. Creative Wales recommend that a record be kept of all reasonable measures that have been considered and taken.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government recognises that the impact on the Covid-19 pandemic has been felt right across the screen sector, not just in relation to physical production activity.  The business model in its entirety is being significantly challenged. The closing of cinemas has had a fundamental effect on distribution routes and pipelines to exploitation have largely been halted. Separate advice has been introduced in relation to the safe re-opening of cinemas, this is contained in <a href="https://gov.wales/culture-and-heritage-destinations-and-venues-guidance-phased-return">Culture and heritage destinations and venues: guidance for a phased return</a>.</p>

<p>There are also significant costs associated with the need to incorporate stricter health and safety practices which will have to be met by companies who are already struggling with cash flow. In addition, restrictions impacting on the wider supply chain are having a knock-on impact in the screen sector. Creative Wales is continuing to work with stakeholders to identify these issues and identify opportunities to support the sector in response.</p>

<p>This sector already makes good use of remote working techniques. We would encourage stakeholders to relay any future issues arising in this subsector related to safe working conditions back to Creative Wales.</p>

            <div><h3>Current situation and key issues</h3>

<p>The Coronavirus Regulations impose a number of restrictions on businesses and other services, including music venues.  These are continually reviewed as we gradually unlock Wales’s economy and there is a <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-covid-19-closure-businesses-and-premises">full list of businesses and premises</a> that must currently remain closed in Wales as a result of the coronavirus. This list is updated following each 21 day review by Welsh Ministers.</p>

<p>If you are permitted to operate your business you must do so safely in a way that complies with any restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus Regulations, in addition to other legal obligations imposed on employers (such as health and safety legislation).</p>

<p>Creative Wales is working very closely in collaboration with the music industry through the recently established stakeholder group representing all areas of the industry. That group has been extremely helpful in establishing a consensus view that the industry recognises it is likely to be one of the very last sectors that is able to return to any form of normal activity. The sector is clear on the need for a long-term strategy for its survival, to address the impact of loss of earnings for a sustained period and to broaden on line training and tools.  There is also recognition of the possible impact of ‘audience confidence’ even when restrictions are eased and venues are able to open. Additional concerns extend to the non-devolved issue of VAT on ticket sales and access to insurance for gigs. </p>

<p>There have been discussions around virtual festivals and other events such as drive in concerts where artists perform on stage together, once rules allow, and audiences safely distance by remaining in vehicles and/or watch from home. Many in the industry have expressed their concerns about the commercial viability of these type of events but it would provide work for those in the live music industry such as stage, PA hire and backstage freelancers.</p>

<h3>Guidance</h3>

<p><strong>Reopen Every Venue Safely (REVS) </strong>- the Music Venue Trust is taking the lead on an initiative called REVS, a phased series of interactions between Government, Music Venue Trust and grassroots music venues exploring options for allowing safe reopening of venues in the future.</p>

<p>The First Minister’s announcement on 19 June on further steps to unlock Wales, confirmed retailers can resume trading if they can take all reasonable measures to comply with the physical distancing duty in Welsh law to reduce the spreads of coronavirus and protect shop workers and shoppers. This announcement covers bookshops.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government has <a href="https://gov.wales/retailers-coronavirus-guidance">produced guidance to support retailers in Wales</a> and is working with the Books Council of Wales to ensure guidance is available to support book shops to reopen safely. The Books Council of Wales is engaging with publishers on the logistical adjustments that will be needed to support shops, for example through publishing schedules, deliveries and marketing.    </p>

<p>The Books Council of Wales has also developed bilingual signage that can be used by book shops in Wales to present information, raise awareness and promote site safety and good hygiene and comply with the physical distancing duty. In addition, the Books Council of Wales is working with the industry to identify suitable suppliers of hygiene and protection equipment.</p>

<p>Guidance has been issued from the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland (BA) to its members, providing a guide for what should be considered as owners begin to consider re-opening their book stores.</p>

<p>Further guidance is available for other sectors of the economy that will support the safe reopening of book shops. Easing of measures or developments in other areas essential to the publishing supply chain, for example schools and libraries, will also have a significant impact on the publishing sector.</p>
