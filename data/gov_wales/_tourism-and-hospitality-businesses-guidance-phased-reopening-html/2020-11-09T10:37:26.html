            <div><p>The purpose of this guidance is to inform businesses working in the visitor economy in Wales of ongoing legal restrictions and requirements related to the coronavirus, and to help them re-open when they are allowed.</p>

<p>The visitor economy encompasses all staying and non-staying visitors and the activities and expenditure involved in supplying products and services for visitors by both the private and public sectors. It covers a multitude of different working environments, from outdoor paid for attractions to indoor attractions like museums. It also includes a variety of activities and events.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed to be relevant for people who work within the visitor economy, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>people who operate or run hotels and other types of accommodation</li>
	<li>people who operate Indoor and outdoor visitor attractions</li>
	<li>people who run or manage spaces for business or leisure events and conferences</li>
	<li>people who run pubs, bars and restaurants for food settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal requirements</h3>

<p>To tackle the spread of coronavirus, the Welsh Government made  the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d994efe-5b30-4572-9a51-3c2594be6285" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">coronavirus restrictions regulations</a> in March 2020. These imposed strict restrictions on gatherings, the movement of people, and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b22e629-81c2-45d2-aa13-29a33d66a342" href="https://gov.wales/closure-businesses-and-premises-coronavirus-covid-19">operation of businesses</a> (some of which were required to close). The Welsh Government prioritises the protection of people, and with this aim, is following a cautious approach to easing lockdown and reopening workplaces. The safety, health, and well-being of everyone is of paramount importance to us.</p>

<h3>Maintaining records of staff, customers and visitors</h3>

<p>Coronavirus will be with us until an effective vaccine is available or there is enough immunity among the population. As lockdown restrictions ease, general rules around <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing</a> and handwashing will remain important in reducing the risk of transmission. In addition, all workplaces and premises open to the public must take <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to minimise the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3ff9479-b25e-4cbf-8149-32862d42ead1" href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect">Test, Trace, Protect strategy</a> will be key in controlling the spread of new outbreaks, particularly as public spaces start to re-open. As people increasingly come into greater contact with others, there is a higher risk of transmitting COVID-19 in some sectors. This is because customers and visitors will spend a longer time on these premises than in other surroundings, and will potentially come into close contact with people outside of their household.</p>

<p>For businesses operating in these sectors, important <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4f78ec5-4365-40b7-9643-6425045b7275" href="https://gov.wales/keeping-records-staff-customers-and-visitors-test-trace-protect">policy guidance from the Welsh Government</a> has been published. This policy guidance describes the important role these businesses play in supporting contact tracing and keeping Wales safe.

<p>ICO guidance to businesses collecting personal data for contact tracing: As hospitality businesses start to re-open the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/global/data-protection-and-coronavirus-information-hub/coronavirus-recovery-data-protection-advice-for-organisations/collecting-customer-and-visitor-details-for-contact-tracing/">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) have issued initial guidance for businesses</a> asked to record and maintain personal data of customers, staff and visitors in support of the test and trace scheme.</p>

<p>Many of the businesses that form part of the visitor economy in Wales were required to close temporarily. These included hotels, holiday parks, campsites, visitor attractions, bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>These restrictions are gradually being eased. This is a phased process and even after being allowed to re-open, all businesses will need to comply with ongoing legal restrictions. Our focus is on maintaining <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social and physical distancing</a> and to minimise the extent to which people mix indoors.</p>

<p>Some businesses have been allowed already to re-open. The current proposals for review, which are subject to change, envisaged future re-opening the visitor economy as follows:</p>

<p>A safe return to work will require compliance with requirements set out in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d994efe-5b30-4572-9a51-3c2594be6285" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">coronavirus regulations</a> namely:</p>

</ol>

<p>Employers must also take <a href="/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law#GuidanceontheprincipalRegulations">guidance</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">supplementary guidance</a> issued under Regulation 7A and 12 into account.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended to assist businesses in the visitor economy consider the steps it should take to ensure a safe reopening for anyone who accesses the business, including staff, visitors and contractors. It also signposts other relevant sectoral specific guidance. In the event of any discrepancy between this guidance and signposted sectoral guidance and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">statutory guidance</a> issued under regulation 7A and 12, you must have regard to the statutory guidance.</p>

<p>This document is not a substitute for legal advice which you should consider obtaining where necessary, nor does it supersede any legal obligations including in relation to health and safety, employment or equalities. It is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. Failure to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks could result in enforcement action by the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>This guidance contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this guidance, members of the public and customers, as well as employees and contractors, and anyone else on premises should be taken into account.</p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take, you need to carry out an appropriate <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">COVID-19 risk assessment</a>, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. This risk assessment should be done in consultation with the recognised trade union or, if there isn’t one, a representative chosen by workers.</p>

<p>Early engagement with the tourism (including hospitality and events) sector, has been essential to developing a phased re-opening. (i.e re-opening of different types of business at different intervals) Since the publication of the roadmap, the sector has continued to develop a joined-up approach and the Tourism Task Force group, together with Regional Fora and discrete sub sector specific guidance e.g. outdoor access, has enabled a consistent, informed approach to consider opportunities that can be presented to the Welsh Government as part of each 21 day review.</p>

<p>We thank all those who have taken the time to be part of that development. By working together the sector has identified a basic framework for a phased return guided by the Welsh Government’s ‘<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cea8af94-4471-482b-beea-e4afc220a69f" href="https://gov.wales/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-wales-roadmap-published">Unlocking our Society and Economy</a>’ roadmap. This document uses as a base the Working Safely during COVID-19 Visitor Economy/Tourism Sector guidance produced by the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS), drafted with input from members of the Visitor Economy Working Group; unions and the devolved administrations; UK Hospitality; VisitBritain; Association of Leading Visitor Attractions; Association of Event Organisers; the Meetings Industry Association, the Events Industry Board; Country Land and Business Association; and in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Public health is devolved in Wales and this Wales specific guidance reflects local public health and safety requirements and legislation in Wales.</p></div>

<p>This document builds on these requirements with practical advice as well as signposting other sector-specific and other relevant guidance. It gives practical considerations of how safe practices could be applied to your business and operation. Each business must have regard to the<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d994efe-5b30-4572-9a51-3c2594be6285" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law"> coronavirus regulations</a> and the statutory guidance and should use this document to help decide what specific actions they could take to operate safely, depending on the nature of the business including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>It will be important for all businesses to maintain a strong working relationship with their respective local authority to ensure that any plans to re-open take into account any local policy and guidance. Local authorities may adopt local policies and guidance to ensure the safe, and managed re-opening of businesses according to the current response to the pandemic within their communities.</p>

<p>The Welsh Ministers must review the need for the requirements and restrictions in the regulations every 21 days taking account of the latest evidence from the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and the advice of the Chief Medical Officer for Wales.</p>

<p>As indicated previously this guidance reflects a continuing conversation between the Welsh Government and the sector, as outlined in the First Minister’s ‘Unlocking our Society and Economy’ roadmap. We will continue to work with stakeholders across the visitor economy to identify where additional guidance may be helpful, especially with the phased easing of the restrictions, and will keep this guidance under review.</p>

<p>We expect that this document will be updated over time. This version is up to date as of 10 August 2020.</p>

<h3>2.1 Key considerations for all businesses</h3>

<p>The steps and activity that you plan should be proportionate (i.e. suitable in size, amount and degree in respect of your business), should be reviewed regularly, and must offer a careful, phased approach to re-opening. Organisations should also focus on creating adaptable solutions that can be paused or rapidly reversed in the event of further COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>

<p>Even when the restrictions are lifted and the opening of specific tourism businesses is permitted, you should only reopen or restart activities when you feel able to do so safely. It is also for each employer to decide when it is the appropriate time to return staff to work from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">Coronavirus Government Job Retention Scheme</a> (JRS) also known as “furlough”. The aim is to enable businesses and individuals working in the visitor economy to protect their staff and reopen their workplaces and enable members of the public to enjoy their offers whilst also minimising risk.</p>

<p>The phased reopening of visitor economy businesses can only be done in accordance with changes to the Coronavirus Restrictions Regulations. All appropriate consideration should also be given to all relevant guidance. A summary of the latest Regulations and guidance are provided as a table of in the appendix.</p>

<p>This guidance should also be considered in the context of other applicable statutory duties and relevant guidance that will affect the way we move forward. These include, restrictions across Wales on the need to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="220125d7-f46e-4283-a698-706e9e7ef999" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolate at home</a> for individuals and households with <a href="/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123">symptoms of coronavirus</a>, the need to adhere to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing measures</a>, <a href="/coronavirus-travel">travel</a>, <a href="/education-coronavirus">education and childcare</a>. Restrictions for extremely vulnerable members of society being advised to <a href="/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people">shield</a> and advice for the wider group of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b4f55b4f-8ec8-4f03-878f-2eba268192e3" href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">people at increased risk</a> from the virus will also have an impact on how organisations are able to address reopening.</p>

<h4>Working within coronavirus regulations and guidelines</h4>

<ul>
	<li>All activity should always be consistent with the government guidance regarding health, social and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">physical distancing</a> and hand-washing and respiratory <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">hygiene</a>. To decide which actions to take, you need to carry out an appropriate <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">COVID-19 risk assessment</a>, just as you would for other health and safety related hazards. This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Timetable for reopening</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Visitor economy businesses should only restart or reopen when permitted to do so in accordance with any relevant easement of the restrictions in the coronavirus restrictions regulations following the regular Welsh Government review, and only then when an organisation feels it is ready to do so.</li>
	<li>
	<p>When planning for any reopening, you will need to consider any notice periods or other arrangements required for furloughed or redeployed staff to return to work.</p>

	<p>Any members of staff who display <a href="/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123">symptoms</a> should <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="220125d7-f46e-4283-a698-706e9e7ef999" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolate</a> at home immediately and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="afe5f359-5cc0-4d11-b207-2a4edb2c48f0" href="https://gov.wales/apply-coronavirus-covid-19-test">apply for a test</a>. No-one who displays symptoms, should be self-isolating or has been told to self-isolate as a contact of a case should attend the workplace.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Planning and preparing workplaces/venues/buildings for reopening</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Plans should be proportionate (i.e. in line with scale of operations) should be reviewed regularly, and must offer a careful approach to reopening.</li>
	<li>As part of the planning for reopening, a number of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">physical interventions</a> might be required in order to implement many of the measures listed in this and accompanying documents. </li>
	<li>You should carry out statutory health and safety buildings checks prior to reopening for staff or visitors (e.g. legionella, water temperature, gas and electrical testing). Local authorities’ Environment Health Officers will be able to give valuable advice on what checks are required prior to re-opening.</li>
	<li>Deep clean public and workforce areas prior to re-opening and implement revised and enhanced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning regimes</a>.</li>
	<li>Provide safer toilets for public use. Refer to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0369f1ef-ac38-495c-99be-2c35f2f6f76f" href="https://gov.wales/providing-safer-toilets-public-use-coronavirus">guidance for the safe management of toilets</a> used by the public.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Equality and diversity</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You must consider the rights of those with protected characteristics and how they can continue to safely access your venue / services.</li>
	<li>You must consider how you will continue to comply with Welsh language duties when implementing any changes in your activities / services.</li>
	<li>Remember that some people do not have internet access. You should make provision for them to be able to make bookings / enquiries offline.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Security and emergency preparedness</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You must consider the security implications of any changes you make to your ways of working. Be mindful of any new vulnerabilities you might inadvertently create when implementing new ways of working. Do not remove any security features without considering protective security in the round.</li>
	<li>You must ensure any COVID-19 adaptations support your emergency preparedness. Issues could include your fire alarm muster stations, access for emergency response teams, dealing with violent or aggressive people and other threatening situations. Check that trained first-aiders are still willing to undertake these roles and update any first-aid training to include COVID-19 protocols.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Health – Test, Trace, Protect</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3ff9479-b25e-4cbf-8149-32862d42ead1" href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect">Test, Trace, Protect strategy</a> exists to enhance health surveillance in the community, undertake effective and extensive contact tracing, and support people to self-isolate where required to do so.</li>
	<li>The Welsh Government has published <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="527aa9a7-706b-4407-b5d3-1ddf5277577f" href="https://gov.wales/employers-coronavirus-test-trace-protect-guidance">guidance on employers' responsibilities to help with COVID-19 testing and contact tracing</a>.</li>
	<li>Contact tracing is an important part of Test Trace Protect strategy which will help us live and work alongside the virus while research continues to find more effective treatments and a vaccine. There is a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8be8b365-1cb8-4a0b-90a0-eb4bf29923a5" href="https://gov.wales/contact-tracing-your-questions">contact tracing question and answer document</a> published by Welsh Government to refer to alongside the guidance above.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Communications</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Public confidence will be key to supporting a successful and commercially viable return to business, and good communications can help to create this.</li>
	<li>People may feel anxious about public gatherings, especially those that take place indoors, for a long period of time (see <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing guidance</a>). Plans for reopening will need to take into account public perceptions and due consideration will also need to be given to local communities in which your organisation exists and operates. Good, sustained communication and links with local communities will be key to increasing confidence in the preparations that have been implemented to minimise the spread of COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Review</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure that all measures are reviewed regularly (at least weekly) and particularly in light of changes to legislation, government guidance, lessons learned and any other examples of best practice elsewhere.</li>
	<li>Also focus on creating adaptable solutions that can be paused or rapidly reversed in the event of further COVID-19 outbreaks (i.e. consider how you would revise your operating practices swiftly should the need arise).</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to use this guidance</h4>

<p>This document sets out guidance on how to work safely. It gives practical considerations of how this can be applied in the workplace.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the following <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5ce95960-e293-4f78-819f-602d56c8e710" href="https://gov.wales/workplace-guidance-employers-and-employees-covid-19">workplace guidance for employers and employees: COVID-19</a> issued by Welsh Government.</p>

<p>You must also have regard to the statutory guidance on taking all <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to maintain physical distancing in the workplace.</p>

<p>As stated previously, this guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account freelancers, agency workers, contractors and other people, as well as your employees</p>

<p>This document also links to additional relevant detailed industry guidance (e.g. <a href="https://www.ukhospitality.org.uk/page/WalesGuidance">UK Hospitality Cymru</a>) and gives practical consideration to how this can be applied in the workplace, which, in the case of the visitor economy, will be different for each premises or outlet.</p>

<p>A site by site approach is essential and risk assessment for premises will be unique. Therefore this guidance should be used to translate to whatever areas are relevant to your business and any measures that are taken should fit appropriately with any operational needs.</p></div>

<p>We know many people are also keen to return to or contribute to volunteering. Organisations have a <a href="https://wcva.cymru/covid-19-guidance-and-resources/">duty of care to volunteers</a> to ensure as far as reasonably practicable they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. This guidance around working safely during COVID-19 should ensure that volunteers are afforded the same level of protection to their health and safety as employees and the self-employed.</p>

<p>In many instances in the visitor economy premises are let out to third party contractors and operators for specific usage. In such cases whilst the premises remain under the direct control of the owner, the actual event or function is under the control of the event planner/organiser.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>Objective</strong>: That all employers carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to assess the risks of COVID-19 and take measures to minimise exposure to the virus.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, having regard to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d994efe-5b30-4572-9a51-3c2594be6285" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">coronavirus regulations</a> and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">statutory guidance</a> and using this document to inform your decisions and control measures. A <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">risk assessment</a> is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your premises. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.</p>

<p>Transmission of COVID-19 is most strongly associated with close and prolonged contact in indoor environments. The highest risks of transmission are in crowded spaces over extended periods and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social and physical distancing</a> is an important mitigation measure. Where a situation means that 2 metre face-to-face distancing cannot be achieved additional reasonable mitigation measures including (but not limited to) <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="318e77cb-e0e4-46b3-930b-caf47309afaa" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public">3-layer face coverings</a> and minimising duration of exposure are adopted required as set out in the statutory guidance.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the potential transmission routes for COVID-19.</p>

<p><img alt="Thinking about risk" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0cfe4344-fd8b-4cb8-aef6-78b8c9f578c3" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Capture_5.PNG" /></p>

<ol>
	<li>Infected individual</li>
	<li>Susceptible individual</li>
	<li>Large particles or droplets</li>
	<li>Large droplets settle to ground in a few seconds</li>
	<li>Medium particles or droplets</li>
	<li>Risk of transmission through direct exposure to respiratory droplets and contact with surface</li>
	<li>Small droplets and aerosols</li>
	<li>Small droplets evaporate to become aerosols (droplet nuclei) in this zone</li>
	<li>Aerosols carried in air currents for minutes to hours</li>
</ol>

<p>Selecting prevention and mitigation measures should use a “hierarchy of control” approach which considers all the potential transmission routes and are bespoke to each setting and activity.</p>

<p>Risks should be reduced to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority.  This is what is meant by a hierarchy of control. The list below sets out the order to follow when planning to reduce risks you have identified in your workplace. Consider the headings in the order shown, do not simply jump to the easiest control measure to implement.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Elimination - Redesign the job or substitute a substance so that the hazard is removed or eliminated.</li>
	<li>Substitution - Replace the material or process with a less hazardous one.</li>
	<li>Engineering controls - for example use work equipment or other measures to prevent falls where you cannot avoid working at height, install or use additional machinery to control risks from dust or fume or separate the hazard from operators by methods such as enclosing or guarding dangerous items of machinery/equipment. Give priority to measures which protect collectively over individual measures.</li>
	<li>Administrative Controls - These are all about identifying and implementing the procedures you need to work safely. For example: reducing the time workers are exposed to hazards (eg by job rotation); prohibiting use of mobile phones in hazardous areas; increasing safety signage, and performing risk assessments.</li>
	<li>Personal protective clothes and equipment - Only after all the previous measures have been tried and found ineffective in controlling risks to a reasonably practicable level, must personal protective equipment (PPE) be used. For example, where you cannot eliminate the risk of a fall, use work equipment or other measures to minimise the distance and consequences of a fall (should one occur). If chosen, PPE should be selected and fitted by the person who uses it. Workers must be trained in the function and limitation of each item of PPE.</li>
</ol>

<p>An illustration of what these proposed measures to reduce risk of exposure would do is available from the <a href="https://iosh.com/media/7811/iosh-risk-assessment-guide.pdf">Institute of Occupational Health</a>.</p>

<p>There are interactive tools available to support you from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) at <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">Managing risks and risk assessments at work</a>.</p>

<p>Risk assessments must reflect the current <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d994efe-5b30-4572-9a51-3c2594be6285" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">Welsh Government legislation and guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Your respective local authority can provide advice to support risk assessments. Public protection departments have the role of supporting businesses as well as enforcement action and advice for the public as consumers. Council officers can provide risk assessment templates, guidance notes and checklists.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">do everything reasonably practicable to minimise</a> them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The risk assessment will help inform decisions and control measures. <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">Guidance and examples of risk assessments are provided by the HSE</a>.</p>

<p>Employers have a duty to consult employees on health and safety. Workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer, supported by their trade union or other representative organisation where appropriate. If the workforce aren’t unionised, you must consult with a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>Employees should be encouraged to identify, speak up and feedback on risks and control measures, so they can be adapted.</p>

<p>When thinking about risk, some key principles include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The need to demonstrate a formal, consistent, and pro-active approach to assessing risk and taking appropriate action.</li>
	<li>Risk assessments should be ‘live’ documents and regularly reviewed.</li>
	<li>Assessing risks should consider harms to both the physical and mental health of staff, volunteers and customers. </li>
	<li>Minimising the need for work related journeys and face-to-face contact.</li>
	<li>How you need to take into consideration the age profile of the workforce.</li>
	<li>A need to consider the minimum safe level of staffing – for example to maintain the specific COVID-19 protocols or in the event of a member of staff or volunteer becoming unwell, or needing to isolate repeatedly. This may determine customer capacity on site.</li>
	<li>On staffed sites, what arrangements need to be put into place in the event of someone becoming unwell whilst on the premises?</li>
</ul>

<p>All risk assessments should recognise that communication, training, and appropriate equipment are significant factors in reducing risk.</p>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to ensure physical distancing, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.</p>

<p>How to raise a concern:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contact your employee representative, if your workplace has one.</li>
	<li>Contact your trade union if you have one.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/concerns.htm">Use the HSE form</a></li>
	<li>Contact HSE by phone on 0300 003 1647</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1 Managing risk</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority.</p>

<p>In the context of minimising exposure to the virus this means implementing these steps in order:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The most effective way to minimise exposure is to enable some or all of your staff to work from home, some or all of their time. There is an expectation that employers should be as flexible as possible and make adjustments wherever that is possible. This may include issuing staff with laptops or mobile phones and facilitating communication from wherever members of staff may be.</li>
	<li>Where working from home is not reasonably practicable, you should <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">take all reasonable measures</a> to ensure that:
	<ul>
		<li>a distance of 2 metres is maintained between any persons on the premises</li>
		<li>that persons only enter the premises in sufficiently small numbers to make it possible to maintain that distance, and</li>
		<li>where persons are required to wait to enter the premises, that a distance of 2 metres is maintained between them.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The requirement to maintain 2 metres distance does not apply to persons from the same household or their <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5acc3842-eb4f-4060-a5e8-d5c96960faf0" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-extended-households-coronavirus">extended household</a>, or between a carer and the person being assisted by the carer. The 2 metre distance does need to be kept between different household/extended household groups, however.</p>

	<p>You should undertake an assessment of what reasonable measures can be taken and keep this under periodic review. Your assessment should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b4f55b4f-8ec8-4f03-878f-2eba268192e3" href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">increased risk</a> from or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6616a000-3b73-4eff-9af2-91dd4cf5d505" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-protecting-people-defined-medical-grounds-extremely-vulnerable-coronavirus-covid-19">extremely vulnerable</a> to COVID-19.</p>

	<p>The online <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="678f3a70-55d4-4a07-ae9d-f19d3c9b7128" href="https://gov.wales/written-statement-all-wales-covid-19-workforce-risk-assessment-tool">COVID-19 Workforce Risk Assessment Tool</a> is a two-stage risk assessment for NHS and Social Care workers, which is suitable for use for all staff who are vulnerable or at risk of contracting COVID¬19, including people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME)backgrounds. Risk assessments are a legal requirement for pregnant women, no matter the size of the business. More information can be found on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website in the <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/2020-05-22-occupational-health-advice-for-employers-and-pregnant-women-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.pdf">COVID-19 virus infection and pregnancy publication</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Where people do need to come within 2 metre of each other and where closer working is required, take all <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to minimise exposure to coronavirus, for example by:
	<ul>
		<li>Limiting the level of face-to-face interaction.</li>
		<li>Increased hand washing and respiratory <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">hygiene</a>, environmental cleanliness and providing reminders about their importance.</li>
		<li>Washing hands well for 20 seconds with soap and drying thoroughly, or using alcohol-based hand gels before and after close contact.</li>
		<li>Using physical barriers.</li>
		<li>Minimising loud noises which will require people to shout over them</li>
		<li>Wearing personal protective equipment where sector specific guidance says it is necessary</li>
		<li>Recording the provision of lead names and contact details to support <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="527aa9a7-706b-4407-b5d3-1ddf5277577f" href="https://gov.wales/employers-coronavirus-test-trace-protect-guidance">Test, Trace, Protect (TTP)</a>.</li>
		<li>Ensuring that those with coronavirus symptoms are not present on the premises and undertaking any necessary <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="527aa9a7-706b-4407-b5d3-1ddf5277577f" href="https://gov.wales/employers-coronavirus-test-trace-protect-guidance">TTP actions required by employers</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Consider how people get to and from work. If employees are spending significant time on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="326985e4-fc69-42ad-bcf7-1d0b53595279" href="https://gov.wales/travelling-safely-coronavirus-guidance-public">public transport</a>, this increases the risk of the virus entering the workplace. You should show flexibility on this issue, including allowing workers to work from different locations where possible, looking at different start and finish times, and supporting workers getting to and from the workplace.</li>
</ol>

<p>The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trade unions. E.g. <a href="https://www.ukhospitality.org.uk/page/WalesGuidance">UK Hospitality Cymru</a> has further information on many parts of the visitor economy that may help with this process: including hotels and other guest accommodation, restaurants, pubs and bars, amusement parks and holiday parks.</p>

<p>You should consider the security implications of any changes you intend to make to your operations and practices in response to COVID-19, as any revisions may present new or altered security risks or issues with accessibility which may need mitigations. Sections 4 and 8 outline the key security considerations and advice.</p>

<p>Whilst the risk to health from COVID-19 is at the forefront of everyone’s minds, the threat of terrorism nonetheless remains substantial. It is essential that businesses and other organisations remain cognisant of these threats as they look to adjust their operations, ensuring that security measures are proactively adapted to support and complement other changes.</p>

<h3>3.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You are required by the coronavirus regulations to provide information to those entering or working at premises about how to <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">minimise exposure</a> to coronavirus.</p>

<p>If you are required by law to have a written risk assessment (where there are 5 or more employees) then significant findings must be written down and control measures put in place. If possible, you should consider publishing the results on your website, a dedicated employee website or employee communications portal (and we would expect all employers with over 50 workers to do so). There may also be other <a href="https://goodtogo.visitbritain.com/your-business-good-to-go-wales">industry standards</a> or marks that you can use to demonstrate to any visitors, guests and customers that you have thought carefully about risk.</p>

<p>The “<a href="https://goodtogo.visitbritain.com/your-business-good-to-go-wales">We’re Good To Go</a>” industry standard marque is a self-assessment scheme that has been designed in partnership with the national organisations (Visit Wales, Tourism Northern Ireland, Visit Scotland and Visit England) to provide reassurance for all sectors of the industry, as well as reassurance to visitors, that businesses have clear processes in place and are following industry and government COVID-19 guidance.</p>

<p>The scheme is free to join and open to all businesses across the industry.</p></div>

            <div><p><strong>Objective</strong>: That wherever possible people should work from home.</p>

<p>There is a recognition that for many workers in the visitor economy this will not be possible. Where that is not possible, employers must comply with the 2 metre <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">physical distancing</a> duty. Nobody should go to work if your business is closed under coronavirus restrictions regulations except for certain specific exemptions.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Considering who is essential to be on the premises; for example, back of house workers should work from home if at all possible.</li>
	<li>Planning for the minimum number of people needed on site to <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">operate safely and effectively</a>.</li>
	<li>Monitoring the wellbeing of people who are working from home and helping them stay connected to the rest of the workforce, especially if the majority of their colleagues are on-site.</li>
	<li>Keeping in touch with off-site workers on their working arrangements including their welfare, mental and physical health and personal security.</li>
	<li>Providing equipment for people to work from home safely and effectively, for example, remote access to work systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1 Protecting people who are at higher risk</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To protect at risk and extremely vulnerable individuals.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Extremely vulnerable individuals have been strongly advised to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6616a000-3b73-4eff-9af2-91dd4cf5d505" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-protecting-people-defined-medical-grounds-extremely-vulnerable-coronavirus-covid-19">shield</a> and not to work outside the home.</li>
	<li>A wider group of individuals, who are at increased risk of severe illness, have been asked to take extra care in observing social distancing and should be helped to work from home, either in their current role or in an alternative role.</li>
	<li>If (but not clinically extremely vulnerable) <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b4f55b4f-8ec8-4f03-878f-2eba268192e3" href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">individuals at increased risk</a> cannot work from home, they should be offered the option of the safest available on-site roles, ensuring that all reasonable measures have been taken in the workplace and they maintain the required distance away from others and from customer-facing roles. If they have to spend time within this distance of others, you should carefully assess whether this activity should continue. If so, further mitigating actions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission between staff (see Section 3 for examples of actions that can be taken). As for any workplace risk you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found. Particular attention should also be paid to people who live with extremely vulnerable individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Providing support for workers around mental health and wellbeing. This could include advice or telephone support.</li>
	<li>See current guidance for advice on who is in the extremely vulnerable and at increased risk groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 People who need to self-isolate</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To make sure individuals who need to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="220125d7-f46e-4283-a698-706e9e7ef999" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolate</a> because they have symptoms of COVID-19 or live in a household or are part of an extended household with someone who has symptoms or those who are advised to self-isolate as part of the government's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3ff9479-b25e-4cbf-8149-32862d42ead1" href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect">Test, Trace, Protect programme</a> do not come into the workplace.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enabling workers to work from home while self-isolating if appropriate.</li>
	<li>See current guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">employees</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">employers</a> relating to statutory sick pay due to COVID-19.</li>

</ul>

<h3>4.3 Equality in the workplace</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To ensure everyone in your workplace has equal opportunities and is treated fairly.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In applying this guidance, employers should note their duty of care to be aware of the particular needs of different groups of workers or individuals.</li>
	<li>It is unlawful to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against anyone because of a protected characteristic such as age, ethnicity, sex or disability.</li>
	<li>In addition, employers also have particular, statutory responsibilities towards disabled workers and those who are new or expectant mothers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Understanding and taking into account the particular circumstances of those with different protected characteristics. </li>
	<li>Involving and communicating appropriately with workers whose protected characteristics might either expose them to a different degree of risk, or might make any steps you are thinking about inappropriate or challenging for them.</li>
	<li>Considering whether you need to put in place any particular measures or adjustments to take account of your duties under the equalities legislation.</li>
	<li>Making reasonable adjustments to avoid disabled workers being put at a disadvantage and assessing the health and safety risks for new or <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/2020-05-22-occupational-health-advice-for-employers-and-pregnant-women-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.pdf">expectant mothers</a>.</li>
	<li>Understanding and responding to the concerns of those who consider themselves at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b4f55b4f-8ec8-4f03-878f-2eba268192e3" href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">increased risk</a>.</li>
	<li>Making sure that the steps you take do not have an unjustifiable negative impact on some groups compared to others, for example those with caring responsibilities or those with religious commitments.</li>

            <div><p><strong>Objective</strong>: To take all reasonable measures to maintain 2 metre physical distancing, including while arriving at and departing from work, while in work and when travelling between sites.</p>

<ul>
	<li>There may be a very limited number of work circumstances where it is not possible to fully enforce physical distancing or amend working practices. If it is genuinely essential that the operation should continue then other <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> need to be introduced. Where the physical distancing measures cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.</li>
	<li>Further increasing the frequency of hand washing and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">sanitisation and surface cleaning</a>, including disinfecting of heavy footfall and frequent touch points such as door handles, countertops, etc.</li>
	<li>Keeping the activity time involved as short as possible.</li>
	<li>Using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible.</li>
	<li>Reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using ‘fixed teams or partnering’ (so each person works with only a few others).</li>
	<li>Using screens or barriers to separate people from each other. These are particularly appropriate where an individual cannot maintain physical distancing and is in contact with a high volume of people such as ticket office staff.</li>
	<li>Physical distancing applies to all parts of a premises where business is conducted, not just the place where people spend most of their time, but also entrances and exits, break rooms, staging sites and store rooms, canteens and similar settings. These are often the most challenging areas to maintain physical distancing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.1 Coming to work and leaving work</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To maintain physical distancing wherever possible for workers, on arrival and departure and to enable handwashing upon arrival.</p>

<p>Consider how people get to and from work and look to provide support to ensure staff are not spending significant periods of time on public transport. You should show flexibility on this issue, including allowing workers to work from different locations where possible, looking at different start and finish times, and supporting workers getting to and from the workplace.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Staggering arrival and departure times at work to reduce crowding into and out of the workplace, taking account of the impact on those with protected characteristics.</li>
	<li>Providing additional parking or facilities such as bike-racks to help people walk, run, or cycle to work where possible.</li>
	<li>Limiting passengers in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6e628fb-ef9a-4bd2-956c-aea709deedd4" href="https://gov.wales/working-or-vehicle-coronavirus-workplace-guidance">corporate vehicles</a>, for example, work minibuses. This could include leaving seats empty.</li>
	<li>Reducing congestion, for example, by having more entry points to the workplace in larger businesses. </li>
	<li>Using markings and introducing one-way flow at entry and exit points which are back of house or employee-only and where appropriate, taking into account premises structure, style of operation and customer profile.</li>
	<li>Providing handwashing facilities (or hand sanitiser where not possible) for workers at entry and exit points. </li>
	<li>Providing alternatives to touch-based security devices such as keypads.</li>
	<li>Defining process alternatives for entry/exit points where appropriate, for example, deactivating pass readers at turnstiles in favour of showing a pass to security personnel at a distance.</li>
	<li>Frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces (such as door handles) where contact is unavoidable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Moving around buildings</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To maintain physical distancing as far as possible while people travel through the workplace.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reducing movement by discouraging non-essential trips within buildings and sites, for example, restricting access to some areas, encouraging use of radios or telephones, where permitted. These items require cleaning between users if multi-use.</li>
	<li>Introducing more one-way flow through buildings. Providing floor markings, where appropriate, and signage should remind both workers and customers to follow <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing</a> wherever possible.</li>
	<li>Reducing maximum occupancy for lifts, providing hand sanitiser for the operation of lifts and encouraging use of stairs wherever possible.</li>
	<li>Making sure that people with disabilities are able to access lifts.</li>
	<li>Regulating use of high traffic areas including stairwells, corridors, lifts, turnstiles and walkways to maintain social distancing and increasing the frequency of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning and disinfection</a> of these areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Workplaces and workstations</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To maintain appropriate physical distancing between individuals when they are at their workstations.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For people who work in one place, workstations should be reconfigured to allow them to maintain physical distancing wherever possible.</li>
	<li>Workstations should be assigned to an individual as much as possible. If they need to be shared, they should be shared by the smallest possible number of people whilst maintaining physical distancing and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaned</a> at each changeover.</li>
	<li>If it is not possible to keep workstations 2 metres apart then businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">take all mitigating actions possible</a> to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reviewing layouts to allow workers to work 2 metres apart from each other.</li>
	<li>Using floor tape or paint to mark areas, where appropriate, to help people keep their distance, or using signage or other communication measures taking into account building characteristics, trading style and customer profile. </li>
	<li>Avoiding people working face-to-face. For example, by working side-by-side or facing away from each other. </li>
	<li>Using screens to create a physical barrier between people.</li>
	<li>Using a consistent pairing system if people have to work in close proximity. For example, cleaning hotel rooms or servicing equipment at an indoor attraction.</li>
	<li>Minimising contacts around transactions, for example, considering using contactless payments and encouraging online booking and pre-payment where appropriate.</li>
	<li>If using cash, encouraging increased handwashing and introducing more handwashing facilities for workers and customers or providing hand sanitiser where this is not practical.</li>
	<li>Rethinking demonstrations and promotions to minimise direct contact and to maintain physical distancing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.4 Accidents, security and other incidents</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To prioritise safety during incidents.</p>

<p><strong>Key point: Physical distancing may not be appropriate in an emergency, if it would be unsafe for people to stay 2 metres apart.</strong></p>

<p>In an emergency (an accident or a fire), it would not be reasonable for people to stay 2 metres apart if it would be unsafe. If anyone is involved in giving assistance to others, they should make sure they comply with the usual sanitation advice immediately afterwards (fully washing hands, safely disposing of any gloves or other PPE).</p>

<p>St John's Ambulance have updated their guidance on emergency assistance during the pandemic. They recommend that first aiders do not perform rescue breaths on anyone requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p>

<p>For more information, make sure that you have checked the <a href="https://www.sja.org.uk/get-advice/first-aid-advice/covid-19-advice-for-first-aiders/">St John's Ambulance emergency advice</a>.</p>

<p>Review your incident and emergency procedures to ensure they reflect the physical distancing requirements as far as possible.</p></div>

            <div><h3>6.1 Top level considerations for all parts of the visitor economy</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To provide top level considerations for managing customers, visitors and contractors.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assessing the number of customers, or crowd density, that can reasonably enable 2 metre physical distancing within any space. This will vary depending on layout or usage. This will require taking into account the total floor space as well as pinch points and busy areas.</li>
	<li>For indoor and outdoor attractions, and business event venues, consider limiting the number of customers or adjusting the crowd density at any time by implementing timed ticketing or asking customers to book ahead where possible.</li>
	<li>Consider how customers and employees will move in congestion areas, for example doorways between adjacent indoor and outdoor spaces.</li>
	<li>Reviewing how customers move through and around the venue (indoors and outdoors) and considering how you could adjust the flow of customers and employees to reduce congestion and contact; for example, queue management or one-way flow, where possible.</li>
	<li>Create clear signage for customers explaining the provisions in place, reminding of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social and physical distancing</a> (including distancing from employees) and promoting the use of contactless payment.</li>
	<li>Managing queues to ensure they do not cause a risk to individuals or other businesses, for example by introducing queuing systems, using barriers and having staff direct customers. This may include using outside premises for queuing where available and safe, for example some car parks. Have contingency plans in place for periods of poor weather.</li>
	<li>Ensuring any changes to entry, exit and queue management take into account reasonable adjustments for those who need them, including disabled customers.</li>
	<li>Encouraging customers to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises to reduce the risk of transmission by touching products or surfaces.</li>
	<li>Reminding customers who are accompanied by children that they are responsible for supervising them at all times and should follow physical distancing guidelines.</li>
	<li>Working with your local authority and landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, including queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks and fire escapes outside and within the public realm </li>
	<li>Working with your immediate, local community to take account of the impact of your activities</li>
	<li>Having clearly designated positions from which employees can provide assistance to customers whilst maintaining 2 metre distance.</li>
	<li>Working with neighbouring businesses and local authorities to consider how to stagger the number of people arriving throughout the day; for example, by staggering opening hours which could help reduce the demand on public transport at key times and avoid overcrowding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Providing and explaining available guidance – specific resources</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To provide links to relevant industry sources and specific resources for each part of the visitor economy.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to the sector specific guidance and resources highlighted below, where relevant. Guidance referenced below from a trade body or association may include best practice documents, templates and more detailed sector specific advice on certain environments. Industry bodies may also be able to provide examples or templates to enable you to carry out an appropriate risk assessment.</p>

            <div><h3>6.3 Overarching security considerations</h3>

<p>Adapting to COVID-19 measures will inevitably result in changes to operating policies, processes and procedures of hotels, indoor, outdoor attractions and business event centres and venues.  Any changes should always be considered alongside security implications. If you have a security department or manager, they should be consulted to help ensure good security is maintained as far as possible and that there are no unintended security consequences as a result of changes. This should be achieved by conducting a security risk assessment.</p>

<p>Specific examples of where security implications may arise are: queueing, search and screening (where this has been directed by a wider government policy on security) maintaining vigilance for potential threats and access controls. There may be others that your organisation will need to consider.</p>

<h4>6.3.1 Queues and physical distancing</h4>

<p>Whilst dense crowding is unlikely if physical distancing is operating correctly, the revised layout of spaces may present new security risks, particularly where multiple queues are created. Considerations include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operators should try and organise queuing within existing protected areas; operators should NOT remove any security features or useful street furniture items without considering protective security in the round.</li>
	<li>If queuing is only possible outside of protected areas then consider and mitigate the vulnerabilities by: routing queues behind permanent physical structures (e.g. street furniture, bollards, trolley parks and bike racks) to provide a visual deterrent and delay; closing off vehicle access to shared spaces; adjusting servicing and delivery times; reducing the opportunities for vehicles (including potentially hostile vehicles) to interact with pedestrians; erecting robust barriers; introducing a reduced speed limit or traffic calming measures.</li>
	<li>Operators should be careful to avoid giving credible, detailed information that could help a hostile identify an attractive target and carry out an attack. In particular, this should not be included in detailed risk assessments published on public websites. Be mindful of messaging, both at the site and particularly on-line, which covers detailed information about queue locations and times, the number of people expected, and suggesting removal of security features such as street furniture, bollards, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.3.2 Search and screening</h4>

<p>Conducting physical search and screening of staff, contractors and customers may need adapting in order to adhere to social distancing measures.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To maintain effective security and deterrence, search and screening should still be conducted as appropriate and in line with the organisation’s policies.</li>
	<li>Ensure security staff are and feel safe. For example, having access to appropriate PPE and hand-washing facilities, and that they are able and confident to raise any concerns.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/staying-secure-during-covid-19-0">Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) has published guidance</a> on adapting existing search and screening processes to take account of physical distancing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-terrorism-support-for-businesses-and-communities/working-with-counter-terrorism-security-advisers#ctsa-contact-list">Details are also available from your local Police Counter Terrorism Security Advisor (CTSA)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.3.3. Staff, security officers and stewarding</h4>

<p>It is vital for staff to remain vigilant and act on potential security threats including terrorism and wider criminality. It is advised to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continue to ensure that awareness of security threats is raised alongside safety and health risks through staff briefings.</li>
	<li>Whilst stewards and security officers may be focussed on managing people and queues for COVID-19 safety reasons, they should continue to remain vigilant for and report any suspicious activity as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Ideally consider providing separate stewarding to manage the social distancing and other safety aspects to enable your security staff to focus on their core responsibilities to keep the site safe from threats.</li>
	<li>Ensure there is a good communication system in place to inform people of any incident. Carry out a short exercise or test to check procedures and equipment are working correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.3.4 Restricted entry points</h4>

<p>Restricted access entry points, such as those facilitated by keypad, biometrics and/or passes should remain fully in operation. They should not be deactivated.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pin pads and biometrics should be highlighted as ‘touch points’ and cleaned regularly (note: generally, they are touched less than door handles)</li>
	<li>Access control (staff) proximity cards will work up to 10cm from the reader. Staff can be informed that there is no need to physically touch the card on the reader.</li>

	<li>Checking whether you need to service or adjust ventilation systems, for example, so that they do not automatically reduce ventilation levels due to lower than normal occupancy levels.</li>
	<li>Most air conditioning systems do not need adjustment, however where systems serve multiple buildings, or you are unsure, advice should be sought from your heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineers or advisers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.2 Keeping the workplace clean</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To keep the workplace clean and prevent transmission by touching contaminated surfaces.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Frequent cleaning of work areas and equipment between uses by using your usual cleaning products.</li>
	<li>Frequent cleaning of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including self-checkouts, trolleys, coffee machines, betting machines or staff handheld devices, and making sure there are adequate disposal arrangements for cleaning products.</li>
	<li>Clearing workspaces, removing waste and belongings from the work area at the end of a shift.</li>
	<li>If you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning after a known or suspected case of COVID-19</a> then you refer to the specific guidance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 Hygiene: handwashing, sanitation facilities and toilets</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To help everyone keep good handwashing and respiratory hygiene through the working day.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa3c1f0c-88c1-41ea-b897-c54dad417538" href="https://gov.wales/safety-and-physical-distancing-signs-employers-coronavirus">signs and posters</a> to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available.</li>
	<li>Providing regular reminders and signage to maintain handwashing hygiene standards.</li>
	<li>Providing hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to washrooms.</li>
	<li>Setting clear use and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0369f1ef-ac38-495c-99be-2c35f2f6f76f" href="https://gov.wales/providing-safer-toilets-public-use-coronavirus">cleaning guidance for toilets</a> to ensure they are kept clean and 2 metre physical distancing is achieved as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Enhancing cleaning for busy areas and common touch points.</li>
	<li>Use of portable toilets should be minimised and special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets where they are in place.</li>
	<li>Use of 2 metre physical distance marking for other common areas such as toilets, showers, lockers and changing rooms and in any other areas where queues typically form.</li>
	<li>Providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collections.</li>
	<li>Providing hand drying facilities – either paper towels or electrical dryers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.4 Handling goods, merchandise and other materials</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To reduce transmission through contact with goods, merchandise and other materials.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Encouraging increased handwashing and introducing more handwashing facilities for workers and customers or providing hand sanitiser where this is not practical.</li>
	<li>Putting in place picking-up and dropping-off collection points where possible, rather than passing goods hand-to-hand.</li>
	<li>Cleaning exterior and interior touchpoints in accordance to sector guidance for example, theme park rides and attractions. Also considering the introduction of hand sanitiser stations immediately before and after customer use.</li>
	<li>Keeping returns separate from displayed merchandise / stock to reduce the likelihood of transmission through touch.</li>

            <div><p>PPE protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks.</p>

<p>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so.</p>

<p>At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">taking all reasonable measures</a> to maintain 2 metre physical distancing on your premises. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not recommended. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace. It needs to be managed through <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">physical distancing, handwashing and respiratory hygiene</a> and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health Wales advises use of PPE. For example, first responders (including first-aiders) and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at: <a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-workers-in-wales/">Information for Health and Social Care professionals – Wales</a>.</p>

<p>Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly.</p>

<p>More information on PPE in Wales: Coronavirus and personal protective equipment (PPE). Welsh Government has published<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc9a3aa0-c554-4632-96b8-36f53528ae91" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-and-personal-protective-equipment-ppe"> guidance on the coronavirus and personal protective equipment (PPE)</a>, this guidance should be followed and will be updated as required.</p>

<p>There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not developed symptoms.</p>

<p>A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where physical distancing isn’t possible. Face coverings should be made up of 3 layers as set out by the World Health Organisation but do not need to be medical-grade face masks. They are not a form of PPE and have a different purpose to that of PPE – see <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="318e77cb-e0e4-46b3-930b-caf47309afaa" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public">FAQs on face coverings</a> for more detail. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards.</p>

<p>It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small. Face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6c5ad47-a382-4e4d-92db-37f04563aa3a" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">managing risk including social and physical distancing</a>, minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would, therefore, not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments.</p>

<p>Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="247a2074-7a90-4cf1-8899-c5214cb81158" href="https://gov.wales/requirement-wear-face-covering-public-transport-wales">except on public transport</a>), including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification.</p>

<p>Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser and dry thoroughly before putting a face covering on, and after removing it.</li>
	<li>When wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands.</li>
	<li>To not hang a face covering from the neck or pull down from the nose.</li>
	<li>Change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you’ve touched it.</li>
	<li>Continue to wash your hands regularly.</li>
	<li>Change and wash or discard (as applicable) your face covering daily.</li>
	<li>If the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer’s instructions. If it’s not washable, dispose of it carefully in your usual waste.</li>
	<li>After wearing a reusable face covering, it should be placed inside a plastic bag prior to it being washed to prevent onwards contamination from the used face covering.</li>
	<li>If it’s not washable, dispose of it carefully in your usual waste.</li>
	<li>Practice social and physical distancing wherever possible as the most effective way of reducing the transmission of COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

            <div><h3>9.1 Shift patterns and working groups</h3>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To change the way work is organised to create distinct groups and reduce the number of contacts each worker has.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As far as possible, where workers are split into teams or shift groups, fixing these teams or shift groups so that where contact is unavoidable, this happens between the same people.</li>
	<li>Identifying areas where people have to directly pass things to each other and finding ways to remove direct contact such as by using drop-off points or transfer zones.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.2 Work-related travel</h3>

<h4>9.2.1 Cars, accommodation and visits</h4>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To avoid unnecessary work travel and keep people safe when they do need to travel between locations.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Minimising non-essential travel – consider remote options first.</li>
	<li>Minimising the number of people travelling together in any one vehicle, using fixed travel partners e.g. always travelling with the same people, increasing ventilation when possible and avoiding sitting face-to-face.</li>
	<li>Cleaning shared vehicles between shifts or on handover.</li>
	<li>Where workers are required to stay away from their home, centrally logging the stay and confirming that any overnight accommodation meets physical distancing guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>9.2.2 Deliveries to other sites</h4>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To help workers <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6e628fb-ef9a-4bd2-956c-aea709deedd4" href="https://gov.wales/working-or-vehicle-coronavirus-workplace-guidance">delivering by vehicle</a> to other sites such as factories, logistics sites or customers’ premises to maintain social and physical distancing and hand washing and respiratory hygiene practices.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Putting in place procedures to minimise person-to-person contact during deliveries to other sites.</li>
	<li>Maintaining consistent pairing where 2-person deliveries are required.</li>
	<li>Minimising contact during payments and exchange of documentation, for example by using electronic payment methods and electronically signed and exchanged documents.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.3 Communications and training</h3>

<h4>9.3.1 Returning to work</h4>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To make sure all workers understand COVID-19 related safety procedures.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Providing clear, consistent and regular communication to improve understanding and consistency of ways of working.</li>
	<li>Engaging with workers and worker representatives through existing communication routes to explain and agree any changes in working arrangements.</li>
	<li>Developing communication and training materials for workers prior to returning to site, especially around new procedures for arrival at work.</li>
</ul>

<h4>9.3.2 Ongoing communications and signage</h4>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: To make sure all workers are kept up to date with how safety measures are being implemented or updated.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ongoing engagement with workers (including through trade unions or employee representative groups) to monitor and understand any unforeseen impacts of changes to working environments.</li>
	<li>Awareness and focus on the importance of mental health at times of uncertainty. The government has published guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19).</li>
	<li>Using simple, clear messaging to explain guidelines using images and clear language, with consideration of groups for which English may not be their first language and with attention to the Welsh Language Standards and guidance.</li>
	<li>Using visual communications, for example whiteboards or signage, to explain changes to production schedules, breakdowns or materials shortages to reduce the need for face-to-face communications.</li>
	<li>Communicating approaches and operational procedures to suppliers, customers or trade bodies to help their adoption and to share experience.</li>

	<li>Minimising unnecessary contact at gatehouse security, yard and warehouse. For example, non-contact deliveries where the nature of the product allows for use of electronic pre-booking.</li>
	<li>Considering methods to reduce frequency of deliveries, for example by ordering larger quantities less often.</li>
	<li>Where possible and safe, having single workers load or unload vehicles.</li>
	<li>Where possible, using the same pairs of people for loads where more than one is needed.</li>
	<li>Enabling drivers to access welfare facilities when required.</li>
	<li>Encouraging drivers to stay in their vehicles where this does not compromise their safety and existing safe working practice, such as preventing drive-aways.</li>
