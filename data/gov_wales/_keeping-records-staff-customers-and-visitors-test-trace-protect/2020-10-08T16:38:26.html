            <div><p>Coronavirus is still with us. As legal restrictions are relaxed and more premises are allowed to open there will inevitably be more physical interaction between people. This means the risk of spreading the virus increases. <a href="/node/29201"><strong>social distancing</strong></a> and good hygiene such as handwashing will be vital in reducing risk of exposure to coronavirus.</p>

<p>However, we must also assume that exposure to the coronavirus will occur. In these cases it is vital that measures are taken to limit its spread. The purpose of our <a href="/node/30253"><strong>Test, Trace, Protect strategy</strong></a> is controlling the spread of new outbreaks but for it to be effective, information about where those who have tested positive may have been in contact with others is essential.</p>

<p>So as people increasingly visit the same places as others, businesses operating in sectors where there is a higher risk of spreading the coronavirus have a key role to play in supporting <a href="/node/30539"><strong>contact tracing</strong></a> and keeping Wales safe.</p>

<p>All businesses that are open to the public should have in place a strict system to comply with social distancing in all locations at all times, and should be following <a href="https://gov.wales/staying-safe-at-work"><strong>staying safe at work guidance</strong></a><em>.</em> Workplaces and premises open to the public are required under Welsh law to take all <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus.  The starting point is preventing physical interaction within a 2 metre distance, and (especially) where this is not reasonably practicable, other measures to minimise close face to face interaction are required, such as use of protective screens, rearranging furniture and other fittings, controlling the flow of people or wearing personal protective equipment. This will minimise the need for the <strong><a href="/node/30253">Test, Trace, Protect</a></strong> service initiating the contact tracing process if a member of staff, customer or visitor to your premises tests positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Where any person tests positive, however, the Test, Trace, Protect<strong> </strong>service needs information about where that person has been, and who that person has been in contact with. Where that person has been on premises open to the public, in particular, the identity of those people may not be known to the person who has tested positive. For that reason, certain businesses are expected to collect and retain information about who has been on the premises, and when, for 21 days.</p>

<p>The purpose of this guidance is to provide advice for organisations and small businesses on collecting and retaining contact information for staff, customers and visitors to their premises.</p></div>

            <div><p>Regulation 12 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2020 requires <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bbb1baad-0a2a-4f04-8dae-a397b6115b24" href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">reasonable measures</a> to be taken to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus on premises open to the public and on any premises where work takes place, as well as to minimise the spread of coronavirus by those who have been on the premises. Regulation 12 provides information about what those reasonable measures, depending on the circumstances, may be. It should be read in conjunction with this guidance and with <a href="/node/29574"><strong>the principal guidance issued by the Welsh Ministers</strong></a> under regulation 13 (of those Regulations).</p>

<p>One reasonable measure is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collecting contact information from each person at the premises or, in relation to persons from the same household, from one of them, and retaining it for 21 days for the purpose of providing it to any of the following, upon their request</p>

<p>(i)  the Welsh Ministers,</p>

<p>(ii)  a public health officer,</p>

<p>(iii) a person designated by the local authority in whose area the premises are located to process information for the purposes of contacting persons who may have been exposed to coronavirus.<em> </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>'Contact information', in relation to a person at the premises, means the person’s name and information sufficient to enable the person to be contacted, to inform them that they may have been exposed to coronavirus at the premises (including a telephone number and the date and time at which the person was at the premises).</p>

<p>Whether this measure is one that is “reasonable” and is, therefore, one that <strong>must</strong> be taken depends on the extent to which people who don’t know each other may interact on the premises and whether there is a risk of close interaction. (See “Who does this apply to?” below).   </p>

<p>By adhering to these Regulations by undertaking <a href="/node/29574"><strong>reasonable measures</strong></a> to maintain records of staff, customers and visitors, and sharing these with the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service when requested, you will help to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic (i.e. are not yet displaying <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="220125d7-f46e-4283-a698-706e9e7ef999" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123"><strong>symptoms</strong></a>). Containing outbreaks is crucial to reducing the spread of coronavirus, protecting the NHS in Wales and saving lives. This will support the country in returning to, and maintaining, a more normal way of life.</p></div>

</div>
              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div><p>There is a higher risk of spreading coronavirus in some sectors. This is because staff, customers and visitors will spend a longer time on these premises than in other surroundings and potentially come into close contact with people outside of their household (or extended household if they have formed one). </p>

<p>The legal requirement under regulation 12 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2020 is based on the notion of doing what is “reasonable”, depending on the circumstances. In the Welsh Ministers’ view, however, as one of the two stated purposes of regulation 12 is to reduce the risk of any person who has been on someone’s premises spreading the virus, it is clearly a reasonable measure for those responsible for the following businesses or premises to collect and retain contact information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>hospitality, including pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes.</li>
	<li>cinemas.</li>
	<li>close contact services including hairdressers, barbers, beauticians, tattooists, sports and massage therapists.</li>
	<li>swimming pools, indoor fitness studios, gyms, spas or other indoor leisure centres or facilities.</li>
	<li>casinos.</li>
	<li>bingo halls</li>
</ul>

<p>On that basis, collecting and retaining contact information for 21 days is a legal requirement in these cases. There may be exceptional circumstances where the information may be required to be kept for a longer period, e.g. where police ask for information 20 days after collection.</p>

<p>However, where people enter premises only for the purpose of collecting something and immediately leaving, for example where a food outlet provides takeaways which is strictly complying with 2 metre physical distancing requirements where customers are waiting, we do not consider that collecting and retaining contact information is a reasonable measure that needs to be taken. This means where a business offers a mixture of a sit-in and takeaway service, contact information is only needed for customers who are sitting in. Similarly contact information is not needed from those making deliveries.</p>

<p>Retail premises are not generally required to collect contact information as the focus is on higher risk settings where they may be close interaction between staff, customers and visitors over a sustained period of time.Tourism accommodation providers collect visitor data through bookings, as a matter of course. </p>

<p>In addition to maintaining records and sharing them when requested, Welsh Government guidance on taking reasonable measures to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus (also issued under regulation 13) and other guidance such as the <a href="/node/31105"><strong>guidance for tourism and hospitality businesses</strong></a> for a phased and safe re-opening should also be followed<em>.</em></p></div>

            <div><p>Information sufficient to enable a person to be contacted to inform them they may have been exposed to the coronavirus.</p>

<h3>Staff</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The names of staff who work at the premises.</li>
	<li>A contact telephone number for each member of staff.</li>
	<li>The dates and times that staff are at work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customers and visitors</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The names of customers or visitors, or if it is a group of people forming a household or extended household, the name of one member of the household – the ‘lead member’.</li>
	<li>A contact telephone number for each customer or visitor, or for the lead member of a group of people.</li>
	<li>Date of visit and arrival and departure time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many businesses that take bookings already have systems for recording their customers and visitors - including restaurants, hotels and hair salons - which can serve as the source of the information above.</p>

<p>If not collected in advance, this information should be collected at the point that visitors enter the premises. You should record the information digitally if possible, but a paper record is acceptable too. You should collect staff, customer and visitor information in a way that is manageable for your establishment. If you have a large booking, for example, at a restaurant, you only need to collect the name and telephone number of the lead member of the party, and the number of people in the party.</p>

<p>Remember that the onus is on the business or person responsible for the premises, <strong>not</strong> the customer or visitor.</p>

<p>Where the data of children may be collected (for example, where a 16 year old person attends the premises), consideration must be given to any associated risk in retaining this information, and further information on these risks can be found on the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/children/">ICO website</a>.</p>

<p>Although it is acknowledged that in certain circumstances this may be difficult, recording departure times as well as arrival times (including staff shift times) is also required. The purpose of this is to reduce the number of customers or staff needing to be contacted (and potentially asked to <a href="/node/29198"><strong>self-isolate</strong></a>) by the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service.</p></div>

You can do this for example, by a verbal explanation, or on your website, or a notice displayed at your premises. Material is available to help you do <a href="https://gov.wales/safety-and-physical-distancing-signs-employers-coronavirus"><strong>this</strong></a>, although please be aware that some people may need additional support in accessing or understanding this information.</p>

<p>Sharing details will support the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service’s efforts to control the spread of the virus. In the circumstance set out above, it is a requirement under regulation 12 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2020 for organisations and businesses to collect and retain the information. We ask that you encourage individuals to share their details and help them understand the reasons why they are required. You should advise them that their details will only be used in the event of a case, cluster or outbreak of coronavirus (i.e. more than one new case of coronavirus) that is tracked back to your premises. The NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service will use this information to check if they, and any person in their party, may have been exposed.</p>

<p>If the individual still does not want to share their details, and you are under a duty to collect those details, they should not be allowed on the premises.  </p></div>

This covers the typical maximum 14-day incubation period of the virus and an additional seven days during which people may be infectious after symptom onset. This will allow for testing and contact tracing, should it be required. After 21 days, this information must be securely disposed of or deleted. When deleting or disposing of data, you must do so in a way that does not risk unintended access (e.g. use cross-cut shredders to dispose of paper documents instead of disposing in public bins, and ensuring permanent deletion of electronic files).</p>

<h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>

<p>The data you are collecting is personal data and, under the GDPR you are a data controller for that data. This means you have certain legal obligations in handling that data and you will need to be satisfied that you are complying with the GDPR so as to protect the privacy of your staff, customers and visitors. This section and more detailed <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) Guidance</a> sets out the manageable steps that you can take to comply in a way that does not impact detrimentally on your business. You may need to register with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> as the data controller for this information.</p>

<p>In the circumstances set out above, regulation 12 of The Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2020 requires certain organisations and businesses to request contact information from your staff members, customers and visitors and share it with the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service for the purpose of their public health functions. This, together with the fact that collection of the data is in  the public interest of providing a public health response to minimise the risk of spreading coronavirus forms a lawful basis for processing personal data under Article 6(1)(c).</p>

<p>You should inform customers that their data may be passed to the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service in the event of a case, cluster or outbreak of coronavirus (i.e. more than one new case of coronavirus) that is tracked back to your premises. If you have a database that holds contact details of regular customers, or if you already collect this information for ordinary business purposes, you will not necessarily have to contact each customer individually, although this will require separate notification and if someone refuses consent, and you are under a duty to collect those details, they should not be allowed on the premises.</p>

<p>GDPR requires that any personal data you collect must be processed fairly and transparently, as well as lawfully. If it has been collected for contact tracing purposes only (i.e. information that you would not ordinarily collect in your usual course of business) it must be used only for those purposes and not for other purposes including marketing, profiling, analysis or other purposes unrelated to contact tracing. There should not be an unjustified detrimental impact on individuals as a result of you collecting and/or sharing their data.</p>

<p>Appropriate technical and security measures must be in place to protect customer contact information, for example, against hacking - see <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/"><strong>ICO guidance</strong></a><em>.</em> These measures will vary depending on how you choose to hold this information, including whether it is collected in hard copy or electronically. Welsh Government would prefer that you take electronic measures, if possible, but we understand that this will not be possible for all.</p>

<p>Individuals have a number of rights under the GDPR (see <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/"><strong>ICO guidance</strong></a> for more details), and you must ensure that these rights can be exercised.</p>
