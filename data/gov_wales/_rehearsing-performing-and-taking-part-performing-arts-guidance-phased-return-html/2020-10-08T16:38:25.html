            <div><h2>1.0	Introduction</h2></div>
      
      </div>
</div>
              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div><p>We are proud to be a nation that values the arts.  Large numbers of people enjoy and take part in creative activities of all sort, as professional and non‑professionals.  The arts illuminate and give life to the wide range of strategies that underpin public life. From arts and health to cultural tourism, public art to town centre re‑generation, the arts bring meaning, authenticity, and enjoyment to our everyday lives. They create and sustain jobs, enrich education services, and bring people together. The arts improve our quality of life and the nation’s well‑being. </p>

<p>The public health crisis associated with the Coronavirus pandemic has, therefore, created unprecedented challenges.  All public activities have been suspended and lockdown measures have been in place since March.  This has prevented most forms of public arts activity.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government’s <a href="https://gov.wales/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-continuing-conversation">‘Unlocking our Society and Economy’ roadmap</a>, published on 15 May 2020, outlines a phased return to public engagement with the arts.  The roadmap indicates that some forms of activity could happen in the ‘amber’ phase of the roadmap (for example, some types of gallery‑based activity).  However, most of the activity, especially where it involves larger gatherings of people, is only likely to be able to be possible later in the ‘green’ phase.  </p>

<p>As the restrictions in Wales start to ease, opportunities to enjoy and take part in the arts will increase.  Freelance arts workers and arts organisations want to return to work and will be hoping to do so as soon as possible.  But progress must be carefully coordinated, with the health of our people the primary consideration. This is a process, not an event. </p>

<p>At present Theatres and Concert halls are unable to open, this guidance has been developed to set out principles you should consider in order to support the return to work.</p>

<p>It contains high-level guidance for organisations and individuals in the performing arts in Wales who rehearse, present, or take part in arts activity.  It is additional to guidance already published by the Welsh Government to assist <a href="https://gov.wales/culture-and-heritage-destinations-and-venues-guidance-phased-return">those managing theatres, arts centres, galleries, and other venues where the arts activity takes place</a>.</p>

<p>Wales, in common with the rest of the UK, is currently experiencing a public health emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Wales introduced strict stay-at-home and social distancing and <a href="https://gov.wales/business-closures-coronavirus">business and premises closure</a> regulations at the end of March 2020.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government reviews the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (as amended) (“COVID-19 regulations”)</a> every 21 days and, on the basis of the latest available medical and scientific evidence, considers whether they need to stay in place or whether they can be eased. <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">Guidance</a> and a set of <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-regulations-guidance#section-41956">frequently asked questions</a> are published to support any amendments.</p>

<p>Emerging successfully from lockdown will depend on finding solutions that control and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 as part of a collective effort towards managing risk. As the First Minister of Wales stated in <a href="https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/leading-wales-out-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic.pdf">Leading Wales out of the coronavirus pandemic – a framework for recovery</a>, relaxing the lockdown should not cause further harm.</p>

<p>A key part of this is the <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-html">Test, Trace, Protect</a> strategy.  This exists to enhance health surveillance in the community.  By undertaking effective and extensive contact tracing, it will support people to secure a test and to <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolate</a> where required to do so.</p>

<p>This guidance provides a framework for decision‑making rather than a set of rules to follow. You must take the initiative in considering and implementing measures that will help to protect workers, volunteers, visitors, and local communities.  Employers must ensure that employees, the self‑employed, volunteers and non-professionals are kept safe.  They must consult with workers and trade unions on appropriate working conditions.  Equally, audiences visiting your venue will also need to be aware of their responsibilities to you, your workers, and performers.  These responsibilities will need to be explained as part of your overall communications strategy.  </p>

<p>The Welsh Government recognises that the measures adopted by performing groups will need to be appropriate, scalable and take into consideration the nature of the planned activity. You should take into account the views of the local community in which your activity takes place. Good communication and links with local communities will be key to increasing confidence and reassuring residents that reasonable <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">measures</a> have been taken to minimise the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Public confidence will be key in supporting a successful and commercially viable return to business. People may feel anxious for some time yet about public gatherings, especially those that take place indoors. Protecting visitors and workers will be a clear and continuing responsibility. </p>

<p>It will be important to judge the financial consequences of resuming activity, in whole or in part, because some of the adjustments that you might be obliged to make could have financial implications.</p>

<p>We understand how keen you are to resume activity. But it is important to work safely. We will continue to work with stakeholders to identify where additional guidance may be helpful, especially with the phased easing of the restrictions as and when they come. You can therefore expect further updates to this guidance.</p>

<p>This guidance is the result of a continuing conversation between the Welsh Government and the arts and culture sector. It should be considered as live guidance which will be regularly updated as circumstances change. It is a conversation that will ask searching questions about how, in the future, the sector operates and who it is for.  The guidance will limit the operations of the sector and may need to be sustained for an unspecified period of time, and may also be retracted if a further set of restrictions was indicated due to increased circulation of the virus</p>

<p>Despite the immediate emergency, there is an opportunity to think imaginatively and bravely about a different sort of future.  An inclusive, fair‑minded and generous society is instinctively inclusive and strives for a whole society’s right to share and participate in the fruits of its cultural riches, especially when they are largely funded by the taxpayer. </p>

<p>Wales has enshrined in law its commitment to the well‑being of all its citizens.  And if we want Wales post‑Covid‑19 to be fair, prosperous and confident, improving the quality of life of people in all the country’s communities, then the cultural sector must now play its part in making the choices that will enable this to happen as activity resumes.</p></div>

            <div><p>This guidance sets out advice on how to rehearse, train, perform and manage performers, audiences, and participants safely while minimising the risk of spreading COVID-19. It offers practical advice on how this can be applied in performing arts workplaces and environments. This guidance only relates to activities permitted by government regulations. <a href="Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (as amended) (“COVID-19 regulations”)">Find more about these regulations</a>.</p>

<p>Each organisation, worker, self-employed person or participant will need to translate this guidance into specific action.  What precisely you do will depend on the nature of your activity, and the size and type of your organisation, and how it is organised, operated, managed, and regulated.</p>

<p>This guidance does not override any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment, or equalities.  It is important that as an organisation or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics.</p>

<p>When considering how to apply this guidance, take into account agency workers, freelancers, contractors, volunteers, participants, and other people, as well as your employees. Also, ensure that nothing you are proposing to do is discriminatory or risks reinforcing inequality.  The Welsh Government has published <a href="https://gov.wales/your-responsibilities-employer-coronavirus">guidance to help employers understand their responsibilities and to allow workplaces to operate as safely as possible</a>. In addition, all workplaces and premises that are open to the public must take all reasonable <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">measures</a> to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees that the timing of when activity can resume will vary.  This applies equally to the reopening of rehearsal and performance spaces, which will vary be reviewed as we progress through the phases for moving out of lockdown. Due to the limitations posed by <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social distancing requirements</a>, some activities will lend themselves to the resumption of business earlier than others.</p>

<p>In responding to this guidance, your plans should be proportionate and manageable within whatever financial constraints you are having to manage. You should review your plans regularly, and adopt a careful, phased approach to resuming activity. How you do this is up to you, but you must work within the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-legislation-and-guidance-law">COVID-19 regulations</a> and clearly demonstrate a proactive approach to promoting safe working.</p></div>

            <div><p>This guidance applies to those who engage in activities in the performing arts including, but not limited to, performers (actors, singers, dancers, musicians, other performers), coaches, choreographers, costume designers, set builders, accompanists, directors, stage managers and other creative, technical and operational production team members. </p>

<p>It also applies to the premises and venues in which performing arts activities take place (whether new or established, traditional or non‑traditional).</p>

<p>It applies to training, rehearsal and pre-production activities, and performances which take place with or without a live audience, wherever these activities occur.  They include opera, musical theatre, choirs, brass and silver bands, comedy and other performing ensembles in music, dance, and theatre.</p>

<p>We recognise within the performing arts that it is common practice to operate in your own and in third parties’ premises or venues (indoors and outdoors).  You might also hire equipment from third parties. Collaboration between groups, organisations and businesses is likely to be needed to ensure a joined‑up approach to the management of risk and to safe working. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://gov.wales/creative-industries-guidance-phased-return-html">guidance should be considered</a> where it is relevant to music production, television production, places of <a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-reopening-places-worship-coronavirus">worship</a>, outdoor events and festivals, indoor unseated music venues, bars and restaurants including those within community halls, schools, colleges, or universities. </p></div>

<p>The First Minister announced on 22 August 2020 the trialling of pilot events to test the mitigation and measures being developed in this guidance, the pilot events will provide vital feedback in the development of this guidance and the consideration of further pilots.</p>

<p>Organisations should consider a wide range of contingencies as part of your planning.  This includes trying, wherever possible, to create flexible, safe, and workable solutions that can be paused or rapidly reversed in the event of further COVID-19 outbreaks.</p></div>

You will therefore be expected to demonstrate that you have thoroughly examined the risks and taken appropriate action to mitigate those risks. </p>

            <div><p>The suspension of live performance and public cultural activity has been one of the most comprehensive shocks to society’s sense of well‑being, as well as to the arts economy.   However, public health crises are not equal opportunities events: the poorest, most marginalised and disabled are generally the worst affected, while the wealthy, connected and healthy are usually better able to weather the storm.</p>

<p>As activity resumes and opportunities for work present themselves, a key point of principle is treating everyone equally, both at work and in the pursuit of work.  No community – especially Disabled/Deaf artists – should be deemed too much of a “risk” in any risk assessment process.  Such processes must factor in disability access at all levels.</p>

<p>In applying this guidance, employers and organisers should be mindful of the particular needs of different groups of workers or individuals.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is breaking the law to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against anyone because of a protected characteristic such as age, sex or disability.</li>
	<li>Employers have particular responsibilities towards disabled workers and those who are new or expectant mothers.</li>
	<li>Employers and organisers should be alert to the fact that those who may be seeking work/are undergoing casting and recruitment have the same rights to protection from discrimination under statute.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will therefore usually be expected to take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Understand and consider the circumstances of those with different protected characteristics, such as those who are hearing or visually impaired.</li>
	<li>Involve and communicate appropriately with workers whose protected characteristics might expose them to a different degree of risk of exposure to the virus.  Consult with them about any steps you are thinking about to check that they are neither inappropriate nor challenging for them.</li>
	<li>Check whether you need to put in place any measures or adjustments to take account of your duties under the Equalities legislation.</li>
	<li>Make reasonable adjustments to avoid disabled workers being put at a disadvantage.  Assess the health and safety risks for new or expectant mothers.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the steps you take do not have an unjustifiable negative impact on some groups compared to others, for example those with caring responsibilities or those with religious commitments.</li>
	<li>Make a positive commitment to communications that enable all people to fully engage in activities, including high visibility signage, appropriate seating allocations, access to hand washing and respiratory hygiene facilities and to safe, secure toilet facilities reserved exclusively for the use of disabled people.</li>

            <div><p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, however mild, you must self-isolate at home for at least 10 days from when your symptoms started. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. You should arrange to have a test to see if you have COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for COVID-19 you also must self-isolate for at least 10 days, starting from the day the test was taken. If you develop symptoms during this isolation period, you must restart your 10-day isolation from the day you develop symptoms.</p>

<p>After 10 days, if you still have a temperature you must continue to self-isolate and seek medical advice. You do not need to continue to self-isolate after 10 days if you only have a cough or loss of smell or taste, as these symptoms can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.</p>

<p>If you live with others, all other household members must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill or if they do not have symptoms, from the day their test was taken. If anyone else in the household starts displaying symptoms, they must stay at home for at least 10 days from when their symptoms appear, regardless of what day they are on in their original 14-day isolation period.</p>

<p>If you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), then you must stay at home for at least 10 days. All other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill.</p>

<p>Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms, you should stay as far away from other members of your household as possible. It is especially important to stay away from anyone who is at risk or extremely vulnerable (shielding) with whom you share a household.</p>

<p>Reduce the spread of infection in your home by washing your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser, and cover coughs and sneezes.</p>

<p>Following a positive test result, you will be contacted by a contact tracer on behalf of the NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service. You will only be contacted after you have had a positive test.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms again at any point after ending your first period of isolation (self or household) then you must follow the same guidance on self-isolation again. <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">Full guidance on self-isolation</a>.</p></div>

            <div><p>This section looks at the management and organisation of workers or participants and their activities, including those who operate on a mobile, peripatetic basis. When considering this advice, legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment, or equalities (and particularly duties towards vulnerable people) continue to apply.</p>

<p>Some restrictions might have practical implications for how the different types of activity are organised, presented and experienced.  However, activities must only take place if they comply with the current advice and regulations. Most of the guidance relies on a common‑sense approach to risk and a willingness to follow guidance accurately and diligently. </p>

<p>Bringing performers and audiences together has obvious risks, especially as it is very difficult to detect who might be unwell and a risk to other people. If you manage a venue, temperature checks using a no‑touch forehead thermometer on entry can be a visible sign to visitors and staff that a number of active approaches are being taken to establishing a COVID safe environment.  No performer, member of staff or audience member should attend if they exhibit any of the symptoms of <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123">COVID-19 or if they have been advised by Track, Trace and Protect that they are a contact or have recently returned from a country that requires quarantine should not be attending the venue.</a></p>

<p>In responding to the guidance and advice in this section, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make sure that you understand the Welsh Government’s COVID‑19 regulations and guidance</li>
	<li>have a plan that explains the approach that you intend to take as you resume activity</li>
	<li>test the practicality of these plans through a thorough risk assessment process</li>
	<li>consult the website of specialist trade and technical associations</li>
	<li>communicate your plans and intentions to those who you will be working and connecting with, or sharing facilities</li>
	<li>have a clear understanding of what the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">social</a> and <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">physical</a> distancing requirements mean for the activities that you are planning</li>
	<li>ensure that all necessary training is provided to those who will be leading and/or co‑ordinating activity</li>
	<li>designate someone with sufficient seniority in your organisation to hold specific responsibility for ensuring that all necessary COVID-safe actions are taken.  That person should be known to all other workers as the “COVID officer”.</li>

<p>Social (physical) distancing</p>

<ul>
	<li>social <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">distancing</a> (2 metres) should be maintained as far as it is practical – plan your programme of activity with the current guidelines in mind</li>
	<li>if your activity requires close physical contact (for example dance), ensure <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-regulations-guidance#section-46349">mitigating measures</a> are in place, such as PPE.   Where PPE or other measures  cannot be used, the performance should be adapted to avoid close contact or work within the discrete clusters.</li>
	<li>use the stairs, wherever practical, and avoid the lifts. If you must use a lift, agree the occupancy limit, and explain this with appropriate signs.</li>
	<li>institute a one-way system to maintain social distancing when moving around the building or rehearsal space.</li>
	<li>ensure that clear signage and floor markings are placed in high traffic areas</li>
	<li>make sure that the needs of disabled people are properly provided for  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cleaning regimes and hygiene</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure additional <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> of hard and regularly touched surfaces, (for example hand‑rails, door handles.</li>
	<li>consider antibacterial fogging in working areas, taking into account all health and safety aspects.</li>
	<li>you need to be prepared with the appropriate PPE supplies and staffing for multiple cleanings per day of common spaces</li>
	<li>cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer must be sufficient to maintain a safe working environment with cleanings multiple times a day</li>

<p>Infection prevention in studios and rehearsal rooms</p>

<ul>
	<li>all physical therapy equipment must be disinfected between uses.  Performers should not congregate in physical therapy spaces and gyms</li>
	<li>adequate time should be allotted for full cleaning of multiple use areas. </li>
	<li>high-touch areas need to be specifically cleaned thoroughly and regularly such as barres, elevator buttons, door handles, ballet barres, copy and fax machines, stair railings, and bathrooms/dressing room areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handwashing and respiratory hygiene</p>

<p>There are general principles you can follow to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses such a COVID-19, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>washing your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food</li>
	<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
	<li>avoid close contact with people who have symptoms</li>
	<li>cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin and wash your hands</li>
	<li>clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home</li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>washrooms have both disposable hand towels and air driers available.</li>
	<li>hand sanitiser stations should be placed at strategic points in the building, including entrances to the building and again to the Stage area.</li>
	<li>hygiene facilities must be accessible to disabled people</li>

            <div><p>Scientific understanding of how COVID-19 virus is transmitted is developing and improving every day. It is known that COVID-19 can be spread by droplets produced by talking, singing, coughing and other vocalisation.  Some of these droplets are relatively large and fall to the ground at a distance of 1-2 metres. Some, however, are much smaller. These aerosol particles remain in the air until blown away.  Good ventilation is therefore a pre‑requisite in any environment where people are being brought together.</p>

<p>Good ventilation can help reduce the risk of spreading Coronavirus, so it will be important to focus on improving general ventilation, preferably through fresh air or mechanical systems.</p>

<p>Where possible, you can consider ways of maintaining and increasing the supply of fresh air, for example, by opening windows and doors (unless fire doors). </p>

<p>According to the advice of the Health and Safety Executive, the risk of air conditioning spreading COVID-19 in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation. </p>

	<li>closing waiting rooms where it is not possible to facilitate social <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">distancing</a>, asking people not to arrive ahead of their allocated time slot, and providing clear instruction not to congregate in other areas if waiting and applying management systems to prevent this.</li>
	<li>preparing for the potential absence of performers due to sickness, for example by increasing number of understudies. Where possible these understudies should not already be in the cast to reduce the number of contact points.</li>
	<li>making adjustment to meet the needs of deaf and disabled deaf workers</li>
	<li>using screens to create a physical barrier between people, for example between casting team or accompanist and candidates.</li>
	<li>considering how to appropriately protect any supporting creative team such as musical accompanists, for example by using screens or ensuring social distancing can be maintained.</li>
	<li>reducing size of cast where possible to reduce the number of contact points, for example by reducing numbers of non-essential supernumeraries, players taking dual roles.</li>

            <div><p>To<strong> </strong>maintain 2m physical distancing between individuals during training, rehearsals, pre‑production and performance, different strategies can be considered. </p>

<p>There is no single ‘right’ answer, but your assessment of what is needed will need to cover at least the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>providing visual reminders of the importance of regular hand washing, with hand sanitiser stations throughout the building.  Basic signage: <a href="https://gov.wales/safety-and-physical-distancing-signs-employers-coronavirus">Safety and physical distancing signs for employers: coronavirus</a>.</li>
	<li>providing space for performers and other attendees to be physically distanced from each other and from any audience, production team members or other individuals.  This should be addressed, wherever possible, during training, rehearsal, pre-production, performance, and any other form of performing arts activity. Guidance on: <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">Taking all reasonable measures to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus in workplaces and premises open to the public</a>.</li>
	<li>working outdoors might, on occasions, offer an alternative. Where this is not possible, you should ensure that all rehearsal, training and performance areas have adequate ventilation (with particular regard to indoor and covered areas).  See 3.2 above.</li>
	<li>if necessary, organising and changing repertoire, rehearsals, training and performance to avoid situations where performers cannot physically distance.  In some cases, this will be challenging. Taking special action could have additional financial costs.  These are factors that will have to be considered when deciding whether it is financially viable to resume certain types of activity.</li>
	<li>reducing as far as possible any time that individuals will not be able to maintain physical <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">distancing</a> (we recognise that this could have implications for the choice of repertoire or type of activity, especially where close physical contact is an integral part of the artform).</li>
	<li>reducing group and cast sizes where possible to maintain 2m physical distancing in accordance with room capacity and any upper limit on numbers of people who may gather indoors.</li>
	<li>if live performance is not possible, consider the use of technology solutions to reduce interactions and ensure adherence to social <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">distancing</a> rules (for example for castings, rehearsals, training and performance).</li>
	<li>closing (or re-purposing) non-essential common areas such as waiting rooms unless they are part of a regular and appropriate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> schedule. Some small rural venues have very limited common areas, often forcing people into corridors, and there should be management systems in place to prevent congregation of people in enclosed spaces.</li>
	<li>using floor tape or paint or other barrier systems to mark areas to help people maintain required social distancing regulations and move around safely where possible.</li>

<p>It also means that a high level of rigour will be required to protect cast and crew when they are on tour.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Promoter and producer have an equal responsibility for ensuring a COVID-safe environment.  As a minimum, they must: </li>

            <div><p>Singing and playing wind and brass instruments, especially in groups, is considered a higher risk activity. This is because of the potential for aerosol production and the absence at the moment of authoritative scientific analysis to assess this specific risk.</p>

<p>The evidence is being developed rapidly. This is, therefore, the initial version of the recommended guidance.  Further guidance will be issued when there is sufficient scientific evidence to support the lifting of restrictions.</p>

<p>The following section sets out the additional actions that you can take to mitigate risk.  This is appropriate to the initial phase of returning to singing and playing wind and brass instruments.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>limit singing or playing in groups or in front of audiences:</li>
	<li>limit singing or playing in groups to group sizes consistent with the appropriate national government advice on social distancing in one discrete space wherever possible based on the country the performance is taking place in</li>
	<li>only consider increasing group numbers if a comprehensive risk assessment has been conducted. This might include, but is not limited to:
	<ul>
		<li>the results of further scientific research currently being conducted;</li>
		<li>the size of the space;</li>
		<li>the ventilation levels within the space;</li>
		<li>the positioning of singers within the space;</li>
		<li>the effectiveness of any booths, barriers or screens in use;</li>
		<li>the use of fixed teams to reduce contacts.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>avoid excess exposure of audiences, crew and other performers by using alternative programmes, technology or re-orchestrating for fewer voices as the first priority.</li>
	<li>observe social distancing between each singer, and between singers and any other people such as conductors, other musicians, audiences or accompanists.  Singer or singers should be treated as all working within a team of named performers who share the stage. They would be treated as contacts should a member of the team became a case.</li>
	<li>encourage special care in cleaning spit or condensation from instruments to prevent the spread of aerosol droplets</li>
	<li>operate outdoors, if it is possible for you to do so  </li>
	<li>if singing or playing indoors, limiting the numbers in line with current guidance to account for the quality of the ventilation of the space and the ability to observe physical distancing.</li>
	<li>for singers and instrumentalists working with other individuals, positioning side-to-side or back‑to‑back and avoiding singing face-to-face even when following the required distance.</li>
	<li>if it is not possible to maintain recommended physical distancing whilst singing, using one or multiple fixed teams (comprising a constant membership) to manage risk of transmission and considering:
	<ul>
		<li>wherever possible, limiting the number of singers and performers in any fixed team to 6. Up to 6 singers may therefore belong to a larger fixed team that includes other instrumentalists;</li>
		<li>ensure that fixed teams socially distance from the audience</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>where limiting fixed team sizes to 6 means professional work cannot resume (for example, a typical musical theatre cast), considering a larger fixed team only if a comprehensive risk mitigation plan has been put in place and social distancing can be achieved.</li>
	<li>This might include, but is not limited to:
	<ul>
		<li>reducing the number of singers and instrumentalists in the fixed team as much as possible, (It is unlikely that this fixed team approach will be possible where professional performers work with more than one group or organisation simultaneously);</li>
		<li>conducting rehearsals and training in smaller fixed teams wherever possible;</li>
		<li>communicating clearly the maximum number of people, consistent with social distancing guidelines, taking into account ventilation and room size, allowed to engage as a fixed team at any one time;</li>
		<li>screening of anyone in a fixed team prior to entry into venues, which may include, but not be limited to, a COVID-19 symptom questionnaire;</li>
		<li>determining what level of monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms is required to achieve as reasonable a level of risk mitigation as possible.</li>
		<li>ensuring there is a clear policy in place for managing a COVID-19 positive individual, and abiding by Welsh Government <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolation</a>, Test, Trace, Protect <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-coronavirus">guidelines</a> and reporting requirements;</li>
		<li>appointing an existing member of staff or of the organisation as a COVID-19 ‘officer’ who will be responsible for oversight of fixed teams, including the risk assessment and ensuring the appropriate mitigations are in place.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>within the fixed team, positioning people side-to-side or back-to-back and avoiding singing or performing face-to-face wherever possible;</li>
	<li>all members of a fixed team <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolating</a> if one member displays symptoms of COVID-19;</li>
	<li>reducing the number of singers or instrumentalists in a cast, choir or ensemble if needed to meet these guidelines.</li>
	<li>consider using booths, barriers or screens if possible between individual singers who are not part of a fixed team, between fixed teams of singers and others, and between performers and any audience, noting that:
	<ul>
		<li>only some types of booth, barrier or screen will be effective enough to be viable for use in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained and some construction material will be more suitable barrier that others e.g. more robust, more easily cleaned.;</li>
		<li>comprehensive risk assessments will be needed whenever using booths, barriers or screens to ensure that transmission risk is appropriately contained and that other health and safety risks such as noise exposure are managed, particularly when using booths, barriers or screens in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>question each performer to make sure that no-one is participating if they are suffering with <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123">symptoms</a> of COVID-19 or when advised to <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus">self-isolate</a>.</li>

If buildings have been closed or had reduced occupancy during the COVID-19 outbreak, water system stagnation can occur due to lack of use, increasing the risks of Legionnaires’ disease. HSE guidance covering water management and legionella is available.</p>

<p>Drinking Water Inspectorate’s guidance on bringing buildings back into use after a period of disuse may be helpful. The guidance covers a range of quality issues that should be considered the guidance is available on the DWIs general web page.</p>

<p>Natural ventilation via windows or vents should be used as far as possible. Where centralised or mechanical ventilation is present, recirculatory systems should be adjusted to full fresh air, if this is not possible systems should be operated as normal. Where ventilation units have filters present ensure enhanced precautions are taken when changing filters.</p>

            <div><p>Arts participation refers to people taking an active role; doing, making and creating.  This is different to attendance which is the relatively passive enjoyment of activities designed and delivered by others.  Participation involves the creation of an outcome by the participant themselves in a first‑hand experience of a form of arts practice. Generally, the individual will be involved in an act of creativity, often guided by a practitioner artist or performer, but requiring creative input by the participant.</p>

<p>Such projects can take place in a variety of places from traditional arts venues to health and social care settings.  As such, you should follow the same artform or place-based guidance that would apply to other types of activity.</p>

<p>Some participatory projects work with highly vulnerable people.  Where this is happening in a healthcare setting, you must follow the policies and protocols issued by the relevant Health Board and Welsh Government </p>

<p>If you are an artist or an organisation leading participatory arts activity you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure that your space/building is COVID‑prepared. A clear and thorough risk assessment should be undertaken before participants return to ensure that the spaces meet appropriate regulation and safety standards.</li>
	<li>ensure that any staff, worker or practitioners have received the risk assessment beforehand and understand the content. You might want to consider a COVID staff manual and training session for staff underlying regulations and tutor responsibilities. An organisation issuing guidelines to staff and contracted artists needs to ensure that they are completely prepared and equipped to lead sessions</li>
	<li>require session leaders to ensure that all equipment is thoroughly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaned</a> between each session including props, sound equipment and audio headsets. Props should not be shared between participants without being cleaned first</li>
	<li>consider the financial implications of restarting sessions.  It is important that everyone returns to work as soon as it is safe to do so, but individuals and organisations should do so in the full knowledge of what extra costs might apply for hiring more staff, running additional sessions with small groups, purchasing cleaning equipment, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the issues affecting Participatory Arts are similar to those for Community Dance.  You should therefore refer to read this section alongside the guidance below in section 3.24.</p></div>
      
      </div>
</div>
              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content-section paragraph--view-mode--default" id="section-50454">
          
            <div><h2>3.24	Community dance</h2></div>

              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div><p>Certain physical forms of performance present particular challenges.  Community Dance is primarily participatory and is largely dependent on physical interaction, often involving close proximity, and physical contact through partner and group dancing. The impact of Covid‑19 and social <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">distancing</a> will require community dance leaders and practitioners having to adapt their practice to find different ways to maintain and manage contact.</p>

<p>The overall size of your group will ultimately depend on your space. The decision must be made with the physical distancing <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">regulations</a> in mind and maximum numbers of people legally allowed to meet. You might need to consider the financial implications of holding extra sessions with smaller groups.</p>

<h4>Community dance groups (working in their own space)</h4>

<p>Community dance groups comprise varied sizes of organisation and work in a wide range of settings.  Many groups have their own studios and venues.  However, dance practitioners are often invited into other settings (such as <a href="https://gov.wales/safe-use-multi-purpose-community-centres-covid-19">community halls</a>, schools and care settings) or operate in hired venues.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure that your space/building is COVID‑prepared. A clear and thorough risk assessment should be undertaken before participants come back to class to ensure that the spaces meet appropriate regulation and safety standards.  Organisers should be aware of legal caps on numbers of people who may attend indoor classes and take into account the capacity of a room to allow 2m social distancing between participants (including tutors, helpers etc).  The Welsh Government guidance for sport recreation and leisure venues may be <a href="https://gov.wales/sport-recreation-and-leisure-guidance-phased-return">useful</a>.</li>
	<li>ensure that all members of staff have received the risk assessment beforehand and understand the content. You might want to consider a COVID staff manual and training session for staff underlying regulations and tutor responsibilities. An organisation issuing guidelines to staff and contracted artists needs to ensure that they are completely prepared and equipped to lead sessions</li>
	<li>remember that sessions and rehearsals could result in participants breathing harder and perspiring. We know that exhaled droplets are a transmitter of viruses. This needs to be taken into consideration with session planning, particularly for dance sessions. The temperature of spaces will be an important consideration. Well‑ventilated spaces are advised, but this could prove a problem to the more vulnerable. Fans that circulate air must not be used</li>
	<li>although outdoor working may be acceptable during the summer, general guidelines need to be considered with regards to this such as noise levels, how working outdoors may require the facilitator and participants to raise their voices more, safety of participants and the wider public, etc</li>
	<li>require session leaders must ensure that all equipment is thoroughly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaned</a> between each session including props and sound equipment. Props should not be shared between participants without being cleaned first</li>
</ul>

<h4>Community dance groups (hiring space)</h4>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure that every space is risk assessed separately and to check that space hired is able to comply with regulations.  Spaces should only be used if they can meet every regulation.</li>
	<li>if you hire space, talk to hire managers for clear guidelines regarding their procedures for following COVID regulations.  You and the venue should share risk assessments.  For instance, the venue may require records relating to the Test, Trace, <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-coronavirus">Protect</a> scheme in which case you will need to put plans in place to comply with this.  You will need to comply with any COVID-19 secure management systems the venue has in place, particularly in relation to room size, maximum capacity allowing for 2m social distancing and legal restrictions on numbers of people allowed to attend.</li>
	<li>ensure that all members of staff have received the risk assessment beforehand and understand the content. You might want to consider a COVID staff manual and training session for staff undertaking regulations and tutor responsibilities. An organisation issuing guidelines to staff and contracted artists needs to ensure that they are completely prepared and equipped to lead sessions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Operational issues: making community dance happen</h4>

<p>Regardless of whether a group is using its own or other’s premises, the following considerations would apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>artists and organisations need to consider the financial implications of restarting sessions – extra costs for hiring more staff, running additional sessions with small groups, purchasing cleaning equipment, etc</li>
	<li>many organisations work with groups of large numbers. Consideration must be given to practical and financial costs of cutting group sizes to accommodate social distancing in relation to room sizes and legal restrictions on maximum numbers.</li>
	<li>all professionals should ensure that their Insurance Companies are aware and informed of all plans. Insurance will require you to follow all governmental procedures</li>
	<li>consider how the public arrive and leave the building. Where possible, map out a one‑way system and use different doors for entering and leaving the space</li>
	<li>Congregating in changing rooms. waiting rooms, foyers etc should be completely avoided.</li>
	<li>identify where, on arrival to sessions, participants leave their belongings so that nothing comes into contact with anybody else. Participants should be asked to remove their shoes before entering the space. Arrival times to sessions should be actively managed to avoid everyone arriving at the same time</li>
	<li>ensure a clear plan regarding use of toilets, particularly for children’s’ groups – the journey to the toilet should not impact on social distancing and strict hand washing and respiratory <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">hygiene</a> should be maintained. A designated ‘responsible adult’ could be identified to support this</li>
	<li>ensure that participants maintain distance, mark out performance areas for each individual on the floor that also includes one way pathways for people who need to arrive/leave their area</li>
	<li>allow sufficient time between events.  Many groups have traditionally run back‑to‑back evening sessions with a 5 minute turn around between each session. More time will be needed to enable participants to leave and arrive safely and undertake <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> between each session. An extra 30 minutes is likely to be needed between sessions and the practical and financial implications of this will need to be considered</li>
	<li>many organisations hold registration and payment processes at the start of each session. Where possible, avoid handling cash and create a system for people to register and pay online.</li>
	<li>consider whether sessions might need an extra member of staff/adult volunteer to support the tutor in maintaining guidelines. Groups might want to consider employing/appointing a ‘COVID Manager’.  Additional members of staff will need to be factored into any maximum number of people set in legislation or allowable in a particular room.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Working with participants</h4>

<p>In addition to the guidelines mentioned above regarding the use of dance spaces, the following should be considered with regard to resuming face to face delivery with dancers of all ages abilities and dance styles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>only if sessions can be safe, distanced and accessible for all participants should they resume</li>
	<li>consider whether sessions might need an extra member of staff/adult volunteer to support the tutor in maintaining guidelines. Groups might want to consider employing/appointing a ‘COVID Manager’.  Additional members of staff will need to be factored into any maximum number of people set in legislation or allowable in a particular room.</li>
	<li>artists, groups and organisations may want to consider consulting with their groups and communities about restarting sessions. Additionally, a statement of preparation issued to your communities might raise confidence in people re-attending</li>
	<li>participants data might be required to be used for the Test, Trace, <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-coronavirus">Protect</a> system. It is important to update GDPR policies so that participants know this and are aware that it may be necessary to pass information on to the scheme.</li>
	<li>you should plan your sessions to avoid physical contact between participants</li>
	<li>depending on the exertion and energy required in your session, it might be necessary to consider marking floor spaces that are larger than 2 metres apart</li>
	<li>the volume of music should be at a level that does not require the tutor to raise their voices in order to avoid projecting aerosol droplets. The use of microphones could be considered</li>
	<li>props should not be shared between participants. All props should be thoroughly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaned</a> at the start and end of each session. You might want to consider avoiding the use of fabric props which are more difficult to clean between sessions unless they can be laundered.</li>
	<li>before sessions resume, consider asking your participants (or their parents/carers in the case of children’s groups) to agree to a ‘disclaimer;’ that they understand that they also have a responsibility to adhere to all COVID-secure guidelines  and instructions within class and agree to not attend sessions if they have <a href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-stay-home-guidance-households-possible-coronavirus#section-38123">symptoms</a>, no matter how mild have a duty to refuse entrance.  However, it must also be kept in mind that children might have a difficulty in understanding and doing what is required of them.  They may require regular reminders of the rules, which will need to be presented in age-appropriate terms.</li>
	<li>ensure your participants know exactly what to expect when they return to sessions including hand washing and respiratory <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">hygiene</a> procedures, entering and leaving the space, how the space will be marked out, toilet procedures and how sessions will be run. Ensure that participants are aware of the Test, Trace, <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-coronavirus">Protect</a> procedures</li>
	<li>ensure that participants only bring what is necessary into the space</li>
	<li>ensure participants wear plenty of layers to work safely in spaces that might need to be well ventilated</li>
</ul>

<h4>Working with vulnerable people</h4>

<p>A lot of participatory arts/community dance work involves working with vulnerable people including children, older people and disabled people. It is essential that any COVID regulations put in place do not impact upon organisations’ policies for Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Adults or create matters of inequality or inaccessibility.  It also should be borne in mind that some groups of people are at increased <a href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">risk</a> of serious illness if they come into contact with the virus.</p>

<p>The following additional issues would also apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>only resume sessions if they can be safe, socially distanced and accessible for all participants</li>
	<li>equality and Accessibility must remain a priority - all guidelines must be considered and planned for with every participant in mind. This is also true for Child and Vulnerable Safety and GDPR regulations. Work with people with disabilities where close and tactile contact has been essential needs to be carefully reworked to ensure safe working without losing the experience</li>
	<li>consider whether sessions might need carers to assist attendees or an extra member of staff/adult volunteer to support the tutor in maintaining guidelines. Groups might want to consider employing/appointing a ‘COVID manager’ additional members of staff and carers will need to be factored into any maximum number of people set in legislation or allowable in a particular room.</li>
	<li>artists, groups and organisations may want to consider consulting with their groups and communities about restarting sessions. Additionally, a statement of preparation issued to your communities might raise confidence in people re-attending</li>
	<li>participants data might be required to be used for the Test, Trace, <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-coronavirus">Protect</a> system. It is important to update GDPR policies so that participants know this and are aware that it may be necessary to pass information on to the scheme.</li>
	<li>risk assessments should be made readily available to partners, venue managers and participants if requested</li>
	<li>session leaders must ensure that all equipment is thoroughly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaned</a> between each session including props and sound equipment. Props should not be shared between participants without being cleaned before and after use.</li>

<p>The overall size of your group will ultimately depend on your space. The decision must be made with the physical distancing <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">regulations</a> in mind and maximum numbers of people legally allowed to meet. You might need to consider the financial implications of holding extra sessions with smaller groups.</p>

<p>Many of the strategies outlined in this guidance for maintaining safe working apply equally to physical theatre and circus activities. Risk assessment is especially important.  The National Association of Street Artists UK: <a href="https://nasauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NASA-UK-COVID-outdoor-arts-Risk-Assessment-considerations-v3.pdf">risk assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Circuses share certain characteristics that are particular to the artform.  For example, most have their own bespoke outdoor venues; and most companies travelling and staying in their own vehicles effectively create their own physical distancing work group. </p>

<p>A key issue is the careful handling of visitors, especially at the beginning and end of shows.  You should make sure that visitors have pre‑booked tickets wherever possible.  You should also ensure the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>advise visitors to check your website before leaving home for the latest event information, arriving in plenty of time to manage physically safe entry to the venue</li>
	<li>introduced social <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-social-distancing-guidance">distancing</a> within queues/ toilets/food stalls</li>
	<li>advise visitors that there might be long queues for toilets due to enhance cleaning, ensuring that you have enhanced cleaning regimes in place between uses.(you should make sure that there are accessible toilets specifically reserved for disabled people)</li>
	<li>are aware that you have installed hygiene screens at food stalls and have introduced enhanced cleaning measures to disinfect high-frequency touch-points such as countertops, handrails etc.</li>
	<li>are aware you will deep clean between shows. Hand sanitiser stations will be available in all areas</li>
	<li>are aware that staff will use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as appropriate to protect themselves and visitors</li>
</ul>

<h4>Outdoor events</h4>

<p>If arranging indoor and outdoor events, care should be taken to ensure that people can continue to take appropriate action to physically distance Please refer to the current guidance on <a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-leaving-your-home-and-seeing-other-people-coronavirus">gatherings</a> when arranging events, taking account of the maximum number of people legally allowed to meet  </p>

<p>Individual businesses or venues should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and apply additional mitigations.</p>

<p>These could include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>further lowering capacity - even if it is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue</li>
	<li>stagger entry times with other venues, taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas and manage entrances and exits to avoid congregation of people</li>
	<li>arranging one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues</li>
	<li>advise patrons to avoid particular forms of transport or routes and to avoid crowded areas when in transit to the venue</li>
</ul>

<h4>Busking</h4>

<p>Busking is a popular form of outdoor activity which can take many forms, from musicians to jugglers, magicians to acrobats.  Much of the general guidance set out here will be applicable to busking. However, there are some specific points relating to the management of crowds and donations that are relevant. </p>

<p>“Keep Streets Live” has published <a href="http://keepstreetslive.com/busking-and-social-distancing">some guidance on this</a>. </p></div>

            <div><p>It is important to minimise transmission and maintain social distancing before, during and after live performances</p>

<p>In responding to the guidance and advice in this section, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure that the size of audience, the arrangements and performances staged are consistent with ensuring safe distancing – risk assessments should specifically consider the maximum capacity for a given performance when the reasonable <a href="https://gov.wales/taking-all-reasonable-measures-minimise-risk-exposure-coronavirus-workplaces-and-premises-open">measures</a> to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus and physical distancing requirements are factored in and the ability to manage audience behaviour</li>
	<li>reduce premises or venue capacity and limiting ticket sales to a volume which ensures 2m physical distancing can be maintained at all times.  Free, open, un‑ticketed and unfenced performances or events will need to demonstrate a reasonable approach to control numbers if too many people begin to arrive and that appropriate social distancing measures are in place</li>
	<li>manage performance scheduling so that audiences for different performances are not using the premises or venue at the same time in a way that compromises adherence to social distancing, and to allow for adequate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a>.</li>
	<li>make sure risk assessments carefully consider worker safety, especially of those working closely with a large number of members of the public or audience</li>
	<li>manage the risk of alcohol impairing social distancing measures through, where needed, controls on the purchase or consumption of alcohol</li>
	<li>consider where crowding could take place such as at points of ingress and egress, car parking, handwashing and toilet facilities, waiting areas, bars and restaurants and areas in proximity to performance area and take appropriate measures to manage the physical distancing and movement of people</li>
	<li>consult with relevant authorities and specialist advice to best evaluate impact, develop mitigating strategies and coordinate relevant external agencies if required.</li>

	<li>where possible, encouraging guests to purchase tickets online and to use e-ticketing. Where this is not the case, encouraging contactless payment.</li>
	<li>allowing for contactless payment and other technology solutions on all purchases made in the premises or venue.</li>
	<li>frequent cleaning of payment points/ticketing equipment that are touched regularly and ensure a constant supply of hot water and soap (via automatic soap dispensers if possible) are available to meet COVID-19 hand hygiene requirements. Also supplies of hand sanitiser where appropriate – e.g. entrance, exit points and payment points etc.</li>
	<li>maintaining social distancing as far as possible when checking tickets and managing entrance points to prevent congregation in doorways etc.</li>
	<li>offer a refund or alternative future event ticket arrangements for individuals who cannot attend due to symptoms / self-isolation as contact or quarantine requires that individuals stay away from the performance rather than attending.</li>

            <div><p>To maintain social distancing when people move around the premises or venue during performances, the following steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>limiting the number of entrances and exits and managing these to prevent congregation of people</li>
	<li>adapting performance scheduling to support social distancing and appropriate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> regimes. For example, scheduling sufficient time between performances to reduce the possibility of different audiences coming into close proximity and to allow time for cleaning.</li>
	<li>using space outside the premises or venue for queuing where available and safe to do so. Outside queues should be managed to make sure they do not cause a risk to individuals, other businesses or create additional security risks, for example by introducing physically distanced queuing systems, having staff direct visitors or audience, and protecting queues from traffic by routing them behind permanent physical structures such as street furniture, bike racks, bollards or by putting up barriers.</li>
	<li>working with your local authority or landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, for example queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks.</li>
	<li>reducing instances where people might be required to queue. For example, at
	<ul>
		<li>entrances and exits to the building;</li>
		<li>escalators, stairs and lifts;</li>
		<li>ticket and concessions kiosks and ticket validation points;</li>
		<li>entrances and exits to auditoria; and</li>
		<li>toilets and washrooms.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>where possible, designating staff to manage queues and regulate guest access between areas.</li>
	<li>ensuring that you have agreed appropriate evacuation procedures and muster points in the event of an emergency</li>
	<li>encouraging visitors to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises or venue.</li>
	<li>using queue management and marking out one-way flow systems through the premises or venue to reduce contact points. For example, introduce one-way systems through the common areas, so that guests are not required to pass each other when entering and exiting these spaces.</li>
	<li>helping visitors maintain social distancing by placing clearly visible markers along the floor or walls, advising on appropriate 2m spacing.</li>
	<li>ensuring any changes to entry, exit and queue management take into account reasonable adjustments for those who need them, including disabled visitors. For example, maintaining pedestrian and parking access for disabled customers.’</li>
	<li>considering the particular needs of those with protected characteristics, such as those who are hearing or visually impaired.</li>
	<li>extra stewarding/marshalling may be needed at key pinch points and care should be taken to remove any barriers at exits that might cause crowding. This should be considered as part of the event’s crowd management plan, in consultation with those responsible for managing security and marshalling etc.</li>
	<li>management of crowd density points, such as where people stop to watch displays, must be considered as part of this planning to ensure social distancing can be maintained.</li>
	<li>limiting the potential for guest contact with performers and support staff by, for example:
	<ul>
		<li>using theatre security to keep stage door areas clear before and after a performance to allow performers and other workers to enter and exit safely;</li>
		<li>not permitting visitors backstage;</li>
		<li>not permitting autograph signing or photographs with performers.</li>

            <div><p>Each auditorium or performance premises or venue should be managed to ensure the maintenance of social distancing.</p>

<p>Key principles to follow for seating include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>audiences should be seated as individuals or groups from the same household or extended <a href="https://gov.wales/guidance-extended-households-coronavirus">household</a>;</li>
	<li>these individuals and groups should maintain 2m social distancing between each other;</li>
	<li>common areas will need to be supervised to ensure social distancing is being maintained</li>
	<li>seating and space for those requiring disabled seating or wheelchair space should be considered within the social distancing arrangements with due regard to accessibility responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional steps that will usually be needed include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Providing seating in a way which ensures social distancing between individuals or groups from the same household or extended household can be maintained. Consider measures such as:
	<ul>
		<li>providing allocated seating and managing seating plans through ticketing systems or manually to ensure 2m social distancing is maintained between different groups and individuals;</li>
		<li>if unallocated seating is provided, installing seat separation or labelling seats which should not be used, or deploying staff to support the audience in adhering to social distanced seating;</li>
		<li>it is expected that guests will take responsibility for their own and others’ welfare and abide by social distancing in the auditorium. Staff should nevertheless be deployed to ensure that these measures are being observed. (This may include signage and announcements, increased checks and supervision, in particular before and at the end of each performance);</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>encouraging audience members not to bring bags and coats into auditoria where possible to reduce clutter at seats.</li>
	<li>allowing for longer intervals so that audience members can safely visit toilets</li>
	<li>reminding guests who are accompanied by children that they are responsible for supervising them at all times and should follow social distancing guidelines.</li>
	<li>having clearly designated positions from which premises or venue staff can provide advice or assistance to guests whilst maintaining social distance.</li>
	<li>cleaning auditoria very frequently and scheduling performances to allow sufficient time to undertake necessary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> before the next audience arrives.</li>
	<li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for welfare facilities to:
	<ul>
		<li>ensure they are kept clean and social distancing is achieved as much as possible; for example, by reducing the number of urinals, cubicles, washbasins and hand dryers available;</li>
		<li>consider the likely patterns of use during a performance, for example during intervals, and modifying entry and exit times  to reduce likelihood of these areas becoming pinch points;</li>
		<li>encouraging guests and audience to take responsibility for their own and others’ welfare.</li>

	<li>cleaning procedures and providing hand sanitiser, before reopening or resuming activity.</li>
	<li>it is important that, prior to reopening all the usual checks are undertaken to make the building is safe.

	<li>drinking Water Inspectorate’s guidance on bringing buildings back into use after a period of disuse may be helpful. The guidance covers a range of quality issues that should be considered the guidance is available on the DWIs general web page.</li>
	<li>natural ventilation via windows or vents should be used as far as possible. Where centralised or mechanical ventilation is present, recirculatory systems should be adjusted to full fresh air, if this is not possible systems should be operated as normal. Where ventilation units have filters present ensure enhanced precautions are taken when changing filters.</li>
	<li>establishing new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning</a> regimes for the premises or venue and determining how they will be delivered effectively with the planned hours of operation, for example on a daily basis or between performances, with some surfaces cleaned regularly throughout the day.</li>
	<li>checking whether you need to service or adjust ventilation systems, for example, so that they do not automatically reduce ventilation levels due to lower than normal occupancy levels.</li>
	<li>most air conditioning systems do not need adjustment.  However, where systems serve multiple buildings, or you are unsure, advice should be sought from your heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineers or advisers.</li>
	<li>using any natural ventilation systems such as doors (except fire doors) and windows where feasible to ventilate enclosed space.</li>

            <div><p>Good communication will be a critical factor in rebuilding public confidence. This is important on a number of levels: within your organisation, for visitors, service users and audiences, and for local communities.</p>

<p>Organisations must publish a clear statement detailing their plans to reopen safely and the steps they are taking to reduce the potential for infection transmission. This should include any new opening times and any changes to how people can safely access their venue. It is also important to review internal and external communications frequently to ensure that they are effective and appropriate.</p>

<p>For internal communications, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>engage with employees directly and also through trades unions to develop and agree any changes in working arrangements;</li>
	<li>introduce re-induction sessions for employees and develop ‘toolbox talks’ (short guidance talks with workers on any changes to work process);</li>
	<li>provide clear and regular communication to improve understanding and consistency of how and why new ways of working are being applied;</li>
	<li>provide training materials on new procedures (consider how these materials are delivered, including online to maintain social distancing between workers);</li>
	<li>focus on the importance of mental health at times of uncertainty and adjust communications and engagement accordingly;</li>
	<li>decide how new safety guidance will be communicated to delivery workers, contractors, and other site visitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>For visitors, service users and audiences, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>emphasise that visitor and worker safety is the priority;</li>
	<li>communicate through social media, websites and email to help them prepare for their visit — providing information about what to expect, what health precautions and social distancing measures have been put in place, what is open and closed, queuing, reduced capacity, and the changed visitor experience, e.g. no interactive interpretations;</li>
	<li>promote pre-booking requirements, entry systems or online free tickets or ticket purchases (including offline options for those with no internet access);</li>
	<li>inform visitors of any changes to booking procedures for a person who is at increased <a href="https://gov.wales/people-increased-risk-coronavirus">risk</a> from the virus or those with protected characteristics (how you will assist disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women so that they can continue to access venues in a safe way, for example, avoiding the need for them to queue);</li>
	<li>provide additional information to visually impaired visitors in advance of visits regarding changed access to buildings or sites and new and more complex visitor routes;</li>
	<li>the use of simple, clear and accessible messaging to explain guidelines, with consideration of groups whose first language may not be Welsh or English or where alternative formats may be required.</li>
</ul>

<p>For local communities, you should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>find out whether your local community is apprehensive about visitor attractions reopening and the associated increase in the number of people travelling to the area;</li>
	<li>work closely with your local community to develop a strategy to not only inform the community of your plans to reopen, but to provide reassurance that additional precautions are being taken and vigorously monitored;</li>
	<li>explain what arrangements are in place for managing visitor numbers and behaviours and what arrangements are in place for reversing a decision to open if necessary;</li>
	<li>work collaboratively with other culture and heritage destinations in your area to send out coordinated communications, ensuring that the same or similar messages are being used to provide reassurance.</li>
