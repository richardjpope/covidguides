            <div><h3>What are the new 10pm restrictions associated with pubs, bars and restaurants with a licence to sell alcohol?</h3>

<p>All licensed premises in Wales must stop selling alcohol at 10pm, and be closed (with no members of the public allowed to be on the premises) by 10.20pm. For pubs, bars and restaurants and all other premises serving alcohol, the 20 minute ‘drink up’ time will minimise the risk of customers all leaving the premises at the same time. It should also provide greater flexibility for restaurants to practice a pattern of 2 evening sittings, and allow a short time for customers to finish their meals. Licensed premises will not be able to re-open until 6am the following morning.</p>

<h3>Will the same restrictions apply to all venues with a licence to sell and serve alcohol on the premises?</h3>

<p>Yes, the same restrictions apply to all licensed premises. This extends to businesses such as cinemas, casinos, bingo halls, bowling alleys, snooker halls and social clubs which have a licence to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises. Cinemas can stay open so that a screening which starts before 10pm can finish, but no alcohol can be served after 10pm.</p>

<h3>What about alcohol served in hotels and other forms of accommodation with a licence?</h3>

<p>Where an accommodation provider has a licence to sell alcohol, they will be required to stop selling alcohol at 10pm and must close the part of their premises in which alcohol is consumed (generally the hotel bar) to customers by 10.20pm. The rest of the premises is not required to close, and room service can continue after 10pm, but may not include alcohol. These restrictions must remain in place until 6am the next day.</p>

<h3>Can alcohol still be served at wedding receptions, civil partnerships or funeral wakes after 10pm?</h3>

<p>Licensed premises hosting wedding receptions, civil partnership receptions and funeral wakes (in accordance with the Welsh rules) must stop selling and serving alcohol at 10pm. The premises (or, in the case of a hotel, the part of the premises in which alcohol is consumed) must close by 10.20pm.</p>

<h3>Do supermarkets, off-licences and convenience stores have to stop selling alcoholic drinks in-store after 10pm?</h3>

<p>Yes. All off-licences, including supermarkets and convenience stores, can remain open but will have to stop selling alcohol in-store from 10pm and cannot begin to sell alcohol again until 6am the next day.</p>

<h3>Will I be able to have an on-line order from a supermarket, including alcohol, delivered to my home after 10pm?</h3>

<p>On-line deliveries from supermarkets and other providers will be permitted after 10pm but must not include alcohol.</p>

<h3>Can premises without a licence to serve alcohol remain open beyond 10pm?</h3>

<p>Yes, premises serving food and non-alcoholic drinks, such as cafes, coffee house chains, fast-food restaurants and take-away premises that don’t have a licence for selling alcohol can remain open beyond 10pm. </p>

<h3>Can pubs and restaurants which have a licence to serve alcohol provide “take-away” delivery services beyond 10pm? </h3>

<p>Take-away delivery service providers, and restaurants, bars, pubs and cafes offering take-away services, can continue to provide food take-away delivery services beyond 10pm. However, food take-away deliveries cannot include any alcohol beyond 10pm, and customers are not permitted to collect their orders directly from these premises from 10.20pm onwards as these premises must remain closed to the public.</p>

<h3>Can licensed premises at ports, airports and service stations remain open after 10pm?</h3>

<p>Yes, licensed premises serving food and drink at ports, airports, service stations and staff canteens can remain open after 10pm but must not serve alcohol after that time, and until 6am the following morning.</p>

<h3>Are blanket restrictions being applied across all areas of Wales?</h3>

<p>Yes, these restrictions apply to all areas of Wales, including local lockdown areas. However there may be additional local restrictions in place which should be considered and applied alongside this guidance.</p></div>

            <div><h2>Table service rules for licensed premises</h2></div>
      
      </div>

              <div>  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content paragraph--view-mode--default">
          
            <div><h3>What are the new “table service” rules for licensed premises?</h3>

<p>The new table service restrictions mean that all premises which have a licence to serve alcohol now need to serve customers only when they are sitting down, generally at a table. Customers must also order, consume and pay for the food and drink at that table. This is regardless of whether they are consuming alcohol as part of their visit. Businesses are encouraged to use smartphone apps for customers to order and pay of food to minimise contact between staff and customers.</p>

<h3>Can I still stand at the bar of a pub or bar and have a drink?</h3>

<p>No. All hospitality businesses in Wales with a licence to sell alcohol must serve food and drink to people who are seated and they must consume it while seated. Sitting at the bar is not allowed. </p>

<h3>Are there any exemptions for licensed premises? What about buffet-service, for example?</h3>

<p>Where a restaurant is operating a buffet service, service of the food can be treated as if has being served to a table. The customer should be taken to the table on arrival and should pay for their meal at their table. However, the customer can select food from the buffet if a face covering is worn to approach the buffet and hand sanitiser is used. In order to minimise contact with high touch utensils, customers should not serve themselves from the buffet. Food should be physically put on the plate by staff rather than customers, and rigorous cleaning regimes should be maintained around the buffet area. Customers visiting the buffet should also maintain a distance of 2 metres from other customers (except between 2 members of the same household or extended household, or a carer and the person assisted by the carer).</p>

<h3>What about “self-service” type canteens in workplaces or education establishments?</h3>

<p>There is also an exception for any workplace canteens, including canteens in educational establishments such as universities operating buffets and that have a licence to sell alcohol. Food or drink must however still be consumed sitting down and alcohol should not be served after 10pm and must close at 10.20pm.</p>

<h3>How do the table service rules impact upon activity-led venues with a licence to service alcohol?</h3>

<p>Activity-led venues with licences to sell alcohol such as bingo and snooker halls, and bowling alleys should ensure food and drink is ordered, served and paid for at the table. Other related activities such as selling bingo tickets, should where possible also be conducted at the table to minimise contact with other customers. The activities themselves (such as bowling or playing snooker) can take place away from the table, but customers are not allowed to do these activities together with anyone they don’t live with or, if they have formed an (exclusive) extended household, in a group of up to 6 people from that extended household.</p>

<h3>Does the new table service only guidance for licensed premises also apply to establishments that do not sell alcohol, for example coffee house chains?</h3>

<p>No, table service restrictions do not apply to establishments that do not sell alcohol. Social distancing of 2 metres should however be maintained between customers whilst queueing at a counter to place their order, and if eating on the premises, food and drink should be consumed at a table.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Are hospitality premises exempt from the rule on face coverings in indoor public places?</h3>

<p>No. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="318e77cb-e0e4-46b3-930b-caf47309afaa" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public">Face coverings are mandatory</a> in all indoor public spaces open to members of the public (applies to all staff and customers aged 11 and over), unless you have a reasonable excuse not to wear one.</p>

<p>For hospitality premises, customers entering and leaving restaurants, pubs, bars, cafes and walking around these premises, and staff working at these premises are now also required to wear a face covering. Customers are allowed to remove face coverings when seated at a table to eat or drink.</p>

<h3>Do I need to wear a face covering if I am collecting a take-away?</h3>

<p>Yes, you do need to wear a face covering if you are buying and collecting food from a take-away or take-away area of a restaurant.</p>

<h3>Can I wear a visor instead of a face covering?</h3>

<p>In the context of the requirements imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic a visor or face shield is not a face covering. It is made of waterproof material, fits loosely over the eyes and extends down such that it may lie over but not cover the nose and mouth. It cannot fit snugly around the nose and mouth as it could impair breathing and may fog. The effectiveness of visors and face shields is unknown at present. They are worn in clinical/care giving settings to protect against large droplet exposure, including by inoculation through the eyes, but when worn outside these settings there is no evidence that face shields/visors protect the wearer or are an effective source control for either larger droplets or small aerosols.</p>

<p>Whilst it is appreciated that some people have difficulty making themselves heard when wearing other types of face covering, visors are designed to protect the eyes from airborne droplets and are not intended for use without a face mask.</p></div>

            <div><h3>How many people are able to sit together indoors at the same table within a café, bar, pub or restaurant?</h3>

<p>Meetings or gatherings indoors within hospitality venues must be limited to 6 people at any one time (not including any children aged under 11), and only include members of your household or extended household (bubble) if you have formed one.</p>

<p>Where a (single) household is made up of more than 6 people aged 11 or over, because they live together, there are no restrictions on the members of that household being together in indoor public spaces like pubs and restaurants. There is also no limit on the number of children aged under 11 who can be part of a gathering indoors.</p>

<h3>What are the rules for forming an extended household?</h3>

<p>The key rules on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5acc3842-eb4f-4060-a5e8-d5c96960faf0" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-extended-households-coronavirus">who belongs to an extended household</a> are that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An extended household can be made up of a maximum of 4 households.</li>
	<li>No person can be part of more than one extended household, with the exception of children who live in 2 homes (for example because their parents have separated and have joint custody).</li>
	<li>All individuals in one home must belong to the same extended household.</li>
	<li>All of the adult members of each household must agree to join the same extended household.</li>
	<li>Once you have agreed and joined an extended household, nobody can leave the extended household to form a new one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are there any restrictions on the number of people who can gather together within a hospitality venue if they are attending a wedding reception, a civil partnership or a funeral wake?</h3>

<p>Wedding receptions and funeral wakes remain at 30 people indoors maintaining social distancing at 2 metres and wearing face coverings.</p>

<h3>What reasonable measures should I take as a hospitality business to ensure that customers are complying with the rule of 6 from a household or extended household?</h3>

<p>You should review any bookings taken prior to the change in Welsh law on the ‘rule of 6’ which came into effect on 14 September.</p>

<p>Where any bookings have been made that do not comply with the single household rule or the rule of 6 from an extended household, a rebooking that complies with the new rules should be taken, a postponement agreed or cancellation made.</p>

<p>You should take all reasonable measures to ensure that individual bookings you take are limited to people from the same household or up to 6 people from an extended household (not including any children aged under 11). You should not knowingly take a booking for over 6 people (unless they are from the same household) by separating the party onto different tables.</p>

<p>You should comply with the rule of 6 from an extended household regardless of whether the booking is being made by guests from outside of Wales where different rules may apply.</p>

<h3>What if it is not commercially viable for my business to operate by maintaining the 2 metre distancing rule between tables?</h3>

<p>If it is not commercially viable for you to include enough tables in your premises at a distance of 2 metres apart, then the tables may be placed closer together as long as mitigating actions are taken to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. This might include installing physical barriers such as protective screens between tables that can be washed and cleaned effectively, back-to-back seating (if the seats are high backed), or side-to-side seating (rather than face-to-face).</p>

            <div><h3>How many customers are permitted to gather outdoors at hospitality premises to eat or drink?</h3>

<p>Individual gatherings/groups of up to 30 people are permitted outdoors and can include a mix of households (not limited to the same/extended household). However social distancing of 2 metres should be maintained between customers if they are not part of the same household or extended household.</p>

<h3>Does the rule of 30 apply to the total space, or an individual group?</h3>

<p>The rule of 30 applies to individual groups or gatherings, and not the total capacity for a hospitality business in an outdoor setting, which can be larger if space allows and social distancing can be maintained. Any such decision should be based on your business having conducted a risk assessment to determine if the capacity adheres to social distancing measures.</p>

<h3>What if it is not commercially viable to maintain the 2 metre distancing rule between a group or gathering who are not all part of the same extended household?</h3>

<p>If it is not commercially viable for you to include enough tables at a distance of 2 metres apart to accommodate the whole party in the outdoor space, then the tables could be placed closer together as long as are taken to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. This might include installing physical barriers such as protective screens between tables that can be washed and cleaned effectively, back-to-back seating (if the seats are high backed), or side-to-side seating (rather than face-to-face).</p>

<h3>Can customers gather under physical coverings outside to protect them from the weather?</h3>

<p>Physical coverings such as awnings, gazebos or marquees should be open-sided (at least 3 or 4 sides) if they are to be considered and treated as an external environment. If they are closed on all sides they should be treated as an internal environment and the rules on indoor gatherings apply.</p></div>

            <div><h3>Is it essential that I continue to keep records of staff, visitors and customers if I sign up to the new NHS COVID-19 app?</h3>

<p>Keeping records of staff, customers and visitors remains compulsory for hospitality businesses in Wales. You should continue to employ your own record keeping system, whether this is based on manual/paper, digital or QR code systems to support the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4f78ec5-4365-40b7-9643-6425045b7275" href="https://gov.wales/keeping-records-staff-customers-and-visitors-test-trace-protect">NHS Wales Test, Trace, Protect service</a>.</p>

<p>This compulsory guidance still applies regardless of where you sign up to the new NHS COVID-19 app and display the new QR poster. This is also regardless of how many posters you put up for your customers, and whether they choose to check in to your venue using this new app.</p>

<h3>How will the new NHS COVID-19 app complement my existing record keeping systems?</h3>

<p>The new app complements the existing mandatory arrangements on keeping records of staff, customers and visitors, by providing your customers with the fastest way to see if they are at risk from coronavirus. The new NHS COVID-19 app does not substitute this guidance and is not essential or mandated. The app works in exactly the same way in England and Wales. The more people who use it, the more it will help to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Is it essential that my business signs up to the new NHS COVID-19 app?</h3>

<p>Hospitality businesses are encouraged to register for the app and display the QR code poster in their venue to enable customers to use the check in function so they can keep track of where they have been. However this is not mandatory in Wales.</p>
